Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,https://www.ratebeer.com/beer/toppling-goliath-kentucky-brunch/166019/,,,4.7,"Boxed beer at home, proper glassware. Pitch black, oily thick pour with a brown head that quickly disappears. Maple upfront alongside roasted coffee, bourbon in the nose. Taste is beautifully layered coffee, chocolate brownie, lots of bourbon barrel character, lots of burnt caramel - with the most balanced balance there is. Big bodied, oily rich mouthfeel, medium carbonation.
Truly one of a kind beer, brewed to perfection.","Boxed beer at home, proper glassware. Pitch black, oily thick pour with a brown head that quickly disappears.

The bottle also pours black with roasted chocolate and oxidized notes. The taste is sweet with soy, dry, and chocolate flavors, along with meaty undertones. The beer is a bit past its best, but the reviewer thanks Craig for the tasting opportunity."

Aromat to największy atut tego piwa. Czekolada, kawa, kakao, lukrecja, trochę bourbonu, drewna, w tle wanilia jest też odrobina melasy, miodu. W smaku niestety gorzej, gorzka czekolada, kawa, toffi, dużo nut palonych,  bardziej wytrawne niż słodkie. Duże oczekiwania, nie do końca spełnione.
Butelka 25 cl, 2019","Dark brown, almost black opaque beer with decent foam that quickly falls and slightly decorates the glass. The aroma is the biggest advantage of this beer. Chocolate, coffee, cocoa, licorice, a bit of bourbon, wood, in the background there is also a hint of molasses, honey. Unfortunately, the taste is worse, bitter chocolate, coffee, toffee, a lot of smoky notes, more bitter than sweet. Great expectations, not entirely fulfilled. Bottle 25 cl,"

Served in a Schramm's snifter, the mead pours a dark reddish/purple color.  I like the aroma a lot, the mead smells like cherries, raspberries, black currants, honey and some earthiness.  Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also a hint of floralness too.  It's fruity, sweet and jammy, but with a nice tart kick too.  Lots and lots of flavor!  Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with pretty much no carbonation.  I thought this was an excellent mead, definitely worth trying if you ever get the chance!","187 ml wax capped and corked bottle, Batch #9.

Mörk djup rödlila, lämnar tjusiga gardiner på glaset. Intensiv och kompakt doft och smak utan att det sticker åt något håll. Bären kompletterar varandra och skapar en snygg helhet - körsbär och mandel som nästan går åt körsbärsklubba i förgrunden, utan att det blir en ren körsbärsbomb. Även mycket vanilj och vaniljsötma. Håller ihop snyggt och oerhört välgjort.","Bottle from Schramm's, batch 9. Dark deep ruby red, leaves beautiful lace on the glass. Intense and compact aroma and taste without going off in any direction. The berries complement each other and create a nice whole - cherries and almond almost going towards cherry brandy in the foreground, without becoming a pure cherry bomb. Also a lot of vanilla and vanilla sweetness. Holds together nicely and incredibly well crafted."

Overall
Incredibly big, intense and extremely vinous. With fascinating tertiary aroma in the glass, I was likely to feel as though it's an old Recioto. One of the best mead I've ever had.
令人难以置信的宏大和集中，同时像极了葡萄酒。杯中涌现出迷人的三类香气，让人有种在喝老年份雷乔托的感觉。我喝过的最好的蜂蜜酒之一。
