very good beer."
Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.0,"In its dark chestnut brown, the Schlenkerla Urbock really does look very rustic. The light brown head is very creamy, but disintegrates quite quickly until only a thumb's width of foam remains. Without even having to raise the glass to your nose, you are immediately greeted by a divine smoky bacon note. In the velvety soft first sip, I come across a mixture of rich, sweet dark malt, roasted malt, espresso and cocoa, while the mild hoppy bitterness lingers in the background throughout. The significant smokiness becomes more apparent towards the middle, to the detriment of the dry, roasted taste. With a mild effervescence, the Schlenkerla Urbock is full-bodied to the typical Bock fat. In the finish, a dry malt bitterness meets an increasing, slightly salty smokiness towards the end. I had a deep and finely composed bock with a consistent, solid smokiness in my glass. Very good!"

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock,4.0,"You could say that this beer burst into my life insolently. Although its appearance and aroma were attractive (elegant dark brown, with a nice and firm layer of beige foam, notable fragrance of toasted malt, whole wheat bread, smoked bacon, mmmh), after the first sip I didn't know if I was tasting a beer or licking an ashtray!, ugh! 
tremendously aggressive, rough, astringent, dry... and with that marked note of... ashes!!?, the first sip hit me right in the mouth. definitely complex... although each new sip was disconcertingly more and more pleasant. My mother, who was tasting a beer of this style for the first time, like me, after the first two sips refused to continue drinking from her glass, she pushed it away with a disgusted face, but I remained there as if hooked, fascinated by this concoction, what I had just tasted was something unique and different, by the fifth or sixth sip I almost perceived it as a work of art. 
Weeks after tasting it, the memory of its flavor and aroma still remained in my mind, I am burning with desire to try it again, I know that I need to try it again."

Aecht Schlenkerla Weichsel Rotbier,3.8,"pours a clear. reddish mahogany coloration with a medium, lasting, creamy head. smells of smoked, slightly caramelly malt and herbal hops, as well as some red berry accents. taste is an excellent balance of smoked, slightly caramelly malt and herbal, earthy, slightly spicy and fruity hops, with red berry notes of cranberry and redcurrant, as well as cherry wood smoke. finishes bittersweet, with a light sweetness and light/medium bitterness, as well as some cherry wood smoke and herbal, earthy hops lingering in the aftertaste. smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

as expected, this new offering from schlenkerla does not disappoint, with a perfect synergy of rotbier and rauchbier. the cherrywood smoke is milder, sweeter and fruitier than the traditional beech smoke, but still has that typical campfire character to it, while the caramel malts and earthy, fruity hops complement this character perfectly."

clear amber-copper. medium-sized, off-white head. moderate retention.
rich buttery nose with luscious smoke showing pepper and burnt wood. not the forceful bacon or some they make, but strong in its own right.  clean, malty.
rich, smokey, peppery, with cherry-like fruitiness, deep malts and good attenuation. nice to take a break from the bacon and a bit more oomph, caramel and toast than the helles, when you're in the mood for thst sort of thing. lots of flavor for its size, too."

Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,3.6,"best dark!!!
I bought the Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel in a Euro bottle from the craft beer shop. The smell of chestnuts, caramel, bread crust and toast is very pronounced. The thumb-thick and fine-pored head is stable, the color brown and clear. On the first sip, surprisingly high effervescence with a strong body and high umami. The balance of aromas and drinking speed is unrivaled. The beer is slightly caramelized, which is balanced out by the roasted aromas. A reference for the ""dark"" beer style."

Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,3.6,"The Altbairisch Dunkel is a deep brown beer with red reflections in the backlight. The head is light brown, very creamy and proves to be very stable even over a longer period of time. The nose detects a lot of grain, dark and roasted malt, but in a rather subtle form. The first sip is deep, dark malty with fine notes of caramel, hazelnut and dark chocolate. A subtle herbal hop with a little orange peel soon adds to the enrichment. It skilfully keeps the rather restrained caramel sweetness in check. The mild effervescence suits this almost full-bodied dark beer very well. The finish is only subtly hoppy, but with a lot more malt bitterness. Wonderful!"

Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,3.6,"date code: l1258 (sep 15, 2021), so firmly in the ""not-so-fresh"" camp. sad, but a fact of life for most european imports around here.

clear dark amber-reddish-brown body. moderately carbonated with small bubbles rising to a thick off-white 1 inch head from a gentle pour.

from the aroma i get caramel, toasted malts, and dark fruit.

the flavor starts with toasted bready malts and dark fruit from the aroma. toffee. a bit of spice. it's light and yet malty. malty and yet not overly sweet. very well balanced and tasty. the finish is lightly bitter with a touch of astringency. 

the body is moderate to thin.

overall, a tasty, malty, and well balanced dunkel."
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,3.6,"Very clear, deep dark red color. Very roasty and very, very malty. Oddly enough, coffee or dark chocolate notes are rather restrained. Just like the hops - which could counteract the sweetness here. Traces of grape juice are present, though. Substance just above medium, mouthfeel almost velvety, only minimally dry. So a very classic, Bavarian dark beer. Very usable, but could certainly be more nuanced. The relationship to the dark Doppelbock Celebrator is clearly recognizable - although this one amplifies everything mentioned and can also add a few new aspects."

Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,3.6,"Visually a very dark chestnut brown with a fine, attractive perlage. The slightly brownish, fine-pored to almost creamy head is watery and fluffy and moderately stable.
The aroma is immediately reminiscent of coffee, dark chocolate, dark caramel and a light vanilla note, but still retains a slightly dusty, fuzzy, grainy character. The aroma is unique!
The first sip has a gentle effervescence, seems very fresh and slightly sweet, roasty and tart. Quite a clear start!
On the palate, a beautiful, tart, malt aroma unfolds, with a very slight acidity that immediately reminds you of coffee. A light base note of grain always remains in play and the sweet, tart note is reminiscent of dark bread crust. There were slightly fruity notes in the background, but they were difficult to define. Most likely overripe stone fruit or overripe banana. But as I said... very subtle. In contrast to other comparable beers, this one is very profound and already achieves a certain complexity - and that with ""only"" 5.0% alcohol.
The mouthfeel and sweetness can be described as very good and it is simply fun to drink this beer.
In the finish, the aromas that have been tasted so far dissipate in a few seconds and turn into a sweet note and a little later into a slight bitterness, whereby the feeling of dark bread crust never completely disappears.
My conclusion: the epitome of a Bavarian dark beer and a real dark beer with character!"

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"6%abv. lambic

poured out pale gold.  4 srm.

nose has aromas of lactic funk referencing buttermilk with a fuller, creamier sour which is much less tart than that of a yogurt.  funk in the nose also suggests barnyard, hay, and sweat.  there is a slightly cheese-like funk to the nose that suggests a hard cheese like aged parmesan.  fruit aromas reference unripe plums, cranberries, and raspberries. 

mouthfeel is full and juicy balanced by an active carbonation from bottle conditioning and a nice rounded sour that is forward, but just short of tart.  

palate has flavors of water biscuit, soda crackers. there is a hint of maltiness at the very end, referencing the above.

hop flavors are woody if present. 

finish is dry with a clean woody, oak-like bitter.  there are some aromatics in the finish that suggest incense, sandalwood, and aged teak. there is a dusty, perfumy aspect to the finish which adds some nice complexity to the overall experience.   an element of  kam  or the dry astringency of an expensive dry ume or chinese huamei rounds the finish off very very nicely indeed.

overall, an enjoyable, complex barrel-aged sour which in palate and character is reminiscent of a belgian gueuze.   i really liked this one, and it may be my particular predilection for spontaneously-fermented and wood-aged sour ales that are the product of multiple organisms each contributing something to the final product.

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"375ml bottled 3/25/15, drunk 10/16/16, thanks to joet for the trade.
beige head is medium-sized and fairly dense, with strong retention for a sour. light ruby-golden body shows high clarity with the sediment left behind.
cherries, oak, vanilla, light balsamic notes and lots of toffee lingering makes for a very light rendition of a flemish sour. but more of the golden variety; like petrus aged pale, perhaps. funky barnyard deftly integrated and there s plentiful berry, cherry, apple and strawberry esters keeping it bright and lively and taking the focus from the strong acidity. malts seem well-attenuated but still present and the oak contributes a bit of vanilla and tannin, without any strong toastiness. no alcohol or flaw.
even, soft, malty body with ample caramel-vanilla and lots of strong brett acids that give way to lactic and light acetic notes, as well. fine carbonation keeps it light and the acid is lightly puckering on the finish. very fruity and yet still balanced if leaning towards fairly acidic/sour. yogurt, light barnyard lots of cherry-like acetic character and soft wood tannin linger on pleasantly. it s been soooo long since i ve had batch 1/ph1 but this seems to be very competent and enjoyable still."
Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"review #2000. yay! 375 ml bottle. bottled on 011012 (batch 5). the beer is a bright, clear gold. no haze apparent at all - i was rather gentle with the bottle. the head is fairly small and pure white. some lacing, bubbles stick around for a good amount of time. the aroma has nice brett funk depth on top of a lacto-forward sourness and a pleasantly sweet herbal flavor. there s good fruity complexity in there with notes of pineapple, lemon, apple, grape, cherry and blackberry. the barrel imparts a solid vinous flavor and moderate oakiness. light dusty, farmhouse note in the background. the taste is dry and medium sour. it s still firmly tart, but i think this is a somewhat less sour batch of beatification, though. lots of barrel character comes through. the finish is woody and vinous with very mild oaky bitterness. mouthfeel is light enough but still pretty round for a relatively low abv sour. there s some body to it. nice clean finish, though. medium pucker. this is one of my favorite american sours, just a wonderful beer. it s strange that it s taken me so long to review it."

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"375 ml bottle poured into an rr -tion glass. batch 5, bottled 1/10/2012. pours a hazy golden-orange body. no much of a head. small bit of white foam that settles to a ring of bubbles. not really lively looking. nice tart fruit aromas. citrus orange and lemon. good dose of white peppery funk, but it s not anywhere near as strong as the best belgian lambics. first sip is tart, quite tart. loads of lemon tang to it. fades quickly, though. wheat and hay permeate the flavor as it fades to a peppery funk in the end. again, it s not moldy cheese funky or nasty sweaty feet sock funky, but it s a touch funky. finishes crisply and without a puckering sour flavor. it actually retains a bit of a sweetness. just a hint. lingering flavors are excellent. this is a well crafted beer. finishes with just a touch of bitterness. really pleasant sour. easily the best from rr and definitely one of the best american wilds out there."

(3.8) 
 

 
older bottle (batch 2, thanks carl!): murky cloudy pour, darker gold, no head, minimal carbonation. lovely complex gueuze-like nose -- cob webs, rubber, musty basement, cheese, funk - there s maybe a little oak left, but not much, and also the grapes/wine have receded to nothingness. taste brings some light sweetness with a really nice funky, fruity tartness. less residual sugar in this dude, and everything just gels better. could totally mistake this for one of the belgians. medium body, soft carbonation, slick coating texture. overall: this is lovely. were texture/appearance a little nicer, this would be 4.3+. 9/3/9/3/17."

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"pours a vibrant golden-honey color. 2 finger white head that recedes into fine lacing. fine carbonation racing up the glass. looks gorgeous. aromas are moderately tart with hints of green apple/grapefruit/lemon grass, coupled with wet oak and basement/cobweb. taste is nicely balanced between fruit tartness and funky yeast. as the nose suggests, some citrus notes of lemon/grapefruit hit initially, with a subtle sweetness rounding out the body. notes of bread/hay in the background. finishes with lively carbonation...not quite fizzy...pushing more tartness across the back of my palate. nice, oaky and dry. fantastic stuff from russian river, per usual."

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"batch 3 - ""this much anticipated brew was not a let down. the brewer claims this to be ""less sour"" than batch #2...i can imagine that, but barely. the aroma is compexity perfected...green apples, barnyard funk, sweet & sour, but not nearly as much sour as is in the taste...almost overpowers the other things going on, but not quite...and your palate adjusts as you go! the difference between this and flemish reds and browns is that this is a blonde, but you couldn t tell by the body. creamy lactose body, although fairly highly carbonated. had to agitate quite a bit just to get some white-ish head atop the cloudy bright yellow body. finish is lingering sour...still on the lips several minutes later. a very very good beer and a great way to break my buddy ben into a new style. he didn t know what to think at first, but really liked it by the end. my wife will probably always hate sours - but i make her try em anyway.""

Russian River Beatification (Batch 002+),4.2,"@ quintessence - hazy golden-yellow color, with a small white head. very funky nose, leather and cheese, fruits, with a subtle sweet touch in it. sourness gets unleashed on the palate in a wild way, tartness, lemon peel and unripe grapes, along with hints of orange and apple. straw and wooden malt feather the sourness a bit, which still comes along pretty untameable. sweet orange stays in a sharp contrast to zingy citrus, along with vinegar and bretts lingering on the palate. high level of acidity is outstanding, chewy and raw, resulting in a very dry and crisp ending.

beatification batch 5

pours a filtered, light yellow color and a fizzy, bubbly head, immediately dissapearing into small sheets of lacing.

lower carbonated, with a very refreshing mouthfeel to it, due to fresh lemons and a balancing, wooden oak infusion. 

the aromas unfold just after popping open the bottle, filling the air in my room with a lovely, citrussy funkiness. reveals even more ripe, juicy citrus when smelling at the actual beer, together with an immense tartness, bedded on glue, yogurt and old leather. creates an interesting interplay between dough, soft old malts and prickly, crisp lemon, without becoming intriguingly complex.

the taste offers a good amount of lemon right from the very beginning, accompanied by easing, bready, musty malts and fermented wheat. lemons get increasingly more body added, resulting in a very sour, funky tartness, almost numbing the front of my tongue during its peak. finishes fruity, with fresh pressed lemons, revealing even lemon stones, as for how pronounced the fruit acidity gets, offering an acceptable dryness. 

the balancing oaky barrel vanishes completely during the beers finish, opening the palate up to pure, sour fruit lemonade. hammers a bit too hard on the palate, regarding its acidic sourness, preventing the beer from showcasing its other, more subdued flavors."

my copy was 14 months before its date.
intense black color, strong opacity.
reddish brown foam, delicate surface coating and crowns the wall.
roasted malt aromas, fine arabica coffee class.
1st palate with great roasted presence.

aftertaste with very harmonious roasted flavors.
length of great character, with a beautiful presence in the mouth.
oily legs, very long.
fine yeast, woody, beautiful line.
alcohol above its level, it ensures the length without problem.
exceptional finish for this type of beer.
conclusion: a dunkler bock from behind the faggots, which has everything of a
great .. and which deserves its gold award with superior mention.
to say that it is the ""best"" Dutch beer, there is a step
that I would not take, even if it has a top rate .. 
all 5 are not equal (nice problem for mathematicians !!)"

is the aroma smoky? yes, there is campfire smoke, there are ash accents, wholemeal bread, so strongly roasted, where roasted sunflower seeds and coffee roast appear. for me a bomb.
the taste is the same, there is smoke, ash and roasted dark bread, a bit of roasted sunflower seeds, light notes of roasted coffee and again the same - smoke, ash and .... it suits me. finish finished with coffee bitterness, intense in reception.
medium carbonation. medium-low fullness. the liquid is smooth and soft, maybe slightly fat mouth. coffee aftertaste, roasted and smoky."
vandeStreek Blackbock,3.6,"vandestreek's contribution to the yearly dutch 'bokbier' season, a black one for that matter - so probably not a bock at all style-wise, but anyway.  longneck bottle from the albert heijn supermarket in hulst in the southern netherlands.  irregularly but tightly paper-lacing, mousy, deep cream-beige, slowly thinning but generally very well-retaining head on an indeed pitch black beer, only revealing its mahogany brown hue at the edges and in the end.  aroma of cold black coffee, bitter black chocolate bars, burnt toast and even charcoal, leather, toasted walnuts, subtler hints of parsley, beef stock cubes, salmiak, caramel, baking soda, tea, touch liquorish.  hardly any sweetness or estery fruitiness in the onset, very clean and immediately malty, with medium carb (or even quite soft for any kind of bock) and a leathery, vaguely beef stock-ish umami aspect as well as a dim, underlying sourishness of roasted grains; supple, oily, medium thick mouthfeel, light nutty and subtly caramelly maltiness, bit resinous and quickly shifting to a strong roasted bitterness, bitter black coffee-like and even a bit ashy, with a salted liquorish-like aspect lingering at the back along with a bitter tea-ish, herbal hop bitterness.  ends roasty-malty, oily and bitter with a slight minerally touch.  very clearly - as expected - this has nothing to do with the dutch 'herfstbok' tradition even if it is marketed as one; this is a simple, supple, straightforward and somewhat thinnish but otherwise perfectly fine dry stout.  appreciating the irony in producing a black bock which is actually a dry stout, i will not deduct points for not being true to style in this case...  but then, even as a dry stout, vandestreek has performed better in many other styles, i think."

pours a mirky dark brown with tanned moussy head.
aroma, well... i know it s the hops, but it smell like a blooming spliff if you ask me! there s even some ashy hint in there, it was very hard after that resin-like marihuana smell to get something of the coffee or bitter chocolate, the roasted malts even...
it has a rather thin mouthfeel, lightly oily, soft to low carbonation, and an reasonably soft bitter aftertaste.
there is a citric high edge to it all, almost metallic, but not unleasantly so.
there s roasted malt, toasted bread, almost floral hoppyness, the joint that has apparently fallen in, has also given its ashlike taste to it, it does really taste a bitt of grass ( yeah, that type of...) . there s also a umami, silt like note in there. as a layman, i must admit i did expect something a bit different from a bock, but if it is a stout, it s not likely to become my favourite...
pitty, because they ve made so many other beautiful beers... well, it s forgiven on my part, but this is really not their best..."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Cherry Wood,4.3,"note: no actual cherries in this beer, but wood from a cherry tree. i wonder if the cherry taste reviewers report are real or subliminal. one review even described this as a fruit beer. a fruit beer without any actual fruit?

same classic bcbs look: deep black topped by a short tan-khaki head with short retention, receding to a thin ring, bubble island, and then nothing. slight lacing if i tip the glass while the head / ring are still present. pretty much no lacing once the ring disappears.

aroma is strong: bourbon and wood, both vying for which is more to the front. some fruitiness in the background.

the taste is different. it'll take me a few sips to try to parse it out. bourbon is there, and the woodiness is quite prominent. the initial taste is a bit harsh, but this quickly transitions to a smooth sweetness, ending with a transition back toward dry (ish - by comparison; it's not actually a dry beer). 

the woodiness of this one sets it clearly apart from the base beer, no doubt due (as mentioned earlier in this thread) to the greater surface area of wood in contact with the beer. i don't get much fruit in the flavor, though. if i try hard enough, i can perhaps detect it, but it is in the background. *i* certainly would not describe this as a fruit beer, and but for the name, fruit may not have been mentioned in my review at all beyond some vague description like ""dark fruit"", which is present in many imperial stouts. hardly any noticeable alcohol warmth, certainly no burn.

the mouth feel is thick, but not as viscous thick as the classic bcbs, ending a bit sticky.

overall, this is high on my list of the variants of years past. iow, i am really enjoying this one. the only other variant i have bought is fourteen. i'll save that one for tomorrow. i still haven't decided if i'm going to try to track down the coke version. 

ps: after some time has passed, as i'm continuing to sip my way to the bottom of the glass, the beer does seem to be finishing drier than it did initially."

solid black pour, with slight ruby highlights. there were a few bubbles when i poured, but i can't expect the effervescence of a beer i've stoppered for a few weeks to match when it's fresh. there is a stronger cherry smell than i noted during the preview. also more of an alcohol nose is noted.
the taste is frankly hitting me up with a bigger note of cherry and bourbon barrel than i had before, too. no tartness or sweetness, just a round cherry finish to the barrel aging. each sip is making me nudge my rating up a point at a time. i may be overreacting, but this may be the hidden surprise of the 2021 crop. not a subtle as the other wood-infused beers, perhaps, but it brings in the cherry without any adjuncts!"

Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier - Unfiltered,4.1,"""light schlenkerla lager beer - special edition unfiltered"", bottle from rewe, stegaurach. - rich golden yellow, hardly cloudy; impermeable foam. - light malt on the nose, mild but fresh lemony hops, a hint of honey and just a hint of smoky notes - you might not even notice them if you didn't know where this beer comes from. - on the first sip, robust citrus-fruity, grassy hop bitterness over full, juicy light malt, lemon peel, honey and a very delicate smoky note. good effervescence, full-bodied, dry. fine citrus bitterness on the finish. long aftertaste. - a touch fresher and crisper than I remember the regular pale lager, with an elegant dryness that contributes even more than the slight smokiness to turning a rather light beer into such a delight. Great class! (April 30, 2021.)"

Aecht Schlenkerla Helles Lagerbier - Unfiltered,4.1,"tasting: blindfolded side-by-side of the regular filtered and the special edition unfiltered versions. bbd filtered: 04-2021 bbd unfiltered: 11-2021 spoiler: i lost the 50:50 battle ;) nose: filtered slightly more woody smoke aroma but very weak in general and more cereal. unfiltered is straighter and a bit more grainy. aroma: filtered is slightly more malty. the minimal smoky notes are almost equal. taste: filtered is slightly sweeter. unfiltered is slighty more bitter. quite a higher bitterness for a helles lager. 30-35 ibu. mouthfeel: filtered is softer, less carbonation. unfiltered is handier/crispier, more straighter clean lager like. the mouthfeel made me make my decision. i thought the more clean and straight one would be the filtered and the softer the unfiltered. but i was wrong. i can only assume that age might played a role here. the unfiltered was super fresh straight from the brewery while the filtered only has one month bbd left. battle no.2 with fresher bbd? *blindfolds off* - both look pretty much the same, the unfiltered gets a minimal haze when pouring the rest of the bottle, not much sediment though. result: i like the unfiltered one more, probably because it s fresher. now trying to find bottles with similiar bbd."

appearance: amber color with medium opalescence. medium-high, fine-bubbled foam, off-white color, falls to the last layer, leaving no major marks on the glass.

aroma: medium volatile. in the foreground soda, sponge cake, cookies, light caramel, bread crust, bread and medium - low phenols, pepper, light spices. the whole is complemented by light perfume alcohol and a subtle note of esters in the form of apple, pear.

taste: more pronounced, complex and very well balanced. start soda sweetness, sponge cake, cookies, light caramel and toffee, bread crust, bread and a note of esters, apple and pear. sweetness is immediately countered, to some extent, by medium-light peppery, slightly spicy phenols and perfume-peppery alcohol. There is also a pleasant phenolic note of vanilla, marzipan. Sweet, smooth in the mouth. Medium-high body, full, medium saturation with a stinging effect on the tongue. Low bitterness, peppery-alcoholic, short, but pleasant. Sweet, balanced and very pleasant finish. Marzipan, light vanilla and peppery and biscuit-sweet notes dominate.

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"brasserie cantillon - bl b r lambic (blueberry lambic) (2022)

brewed for drikkeriget

style: lambic - fruit

alcohol: 5% vol.

bottled in brussels

season: 2021/2022

made in cooperation with jeppe from olbuttikken in copenhagen. jeppe provides the blueberries for the beer, and it is brewed at cantillon and then shipped back to copenhagen and only sold at drikkeriget.

color: ruby-berry, slightly hazy.

foam: pink-reddish foam that rises to the top after swirling the glass. dot marks on the glass.

smell: in the aroma the beginning of a stable, horse, leather deck. then some oak wood and tons and tons of Kamchatka berries.

taste: taste intensely focused on berries. you can feel their sweetness, as well as their skin and flesh. there are also a lot of wine tannins, light oak, a bit of funky and yogurt with pieces of dark fruit.
it is not vinegary, rough, or twisting. the sourness is balanced. every now and then a light spice comes through.
smooth, light, drinkable.

summary:

an extremely balanced blab r. strongly focused on fruit. you can feel the sweetness and sourness of the berries, the skin dryness, a slight funky and stable (mainly in the aroma). there is also a bit of tannin and a slightly stringy finish. malcontents will say that it has lambic here, and at times it resembles sour ale. it does not bother me. sour balanced, a dash of spice.

excellently drinkable and very light in reception.

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottle at cantillon. pours dark violet blue. aroma is wonderful sweet blueberries. taste is more straight forward lambic with much less subtle, yet still sweet berry tinged. really balanced, classic how the aroma is big on the addition, but the flavor isn't overpowered. totally subjective but i prefer the sour fruits to this."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"750ml (thx, jens a. b.!) shared with ryan in riga's apartment after mbcc. vintage 2018.
appearance: hazy purple with a rose head.
aroma: a mix of funk and blueberries accompanied by tannins coming from blueberry skins.
taste: along the same lines. it's more on the funk side now than on the berries side. but berries are still nice.
overall: wondering how this one would be when it was 1-2 years old, not like 5 yo as now. it probably could be more on the berries side. however, it's a great beer still, no doubt."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"when jeppe-jarnit bergs , brother of mikkeller founder mikkel borg bergs  and himself later the brewer of evil twin, opened the  lbutikken beer shop in copenhagen fifteen years ago, he probably hardly realised that he and his brother more or less started a revolution in europe: the craft beer revolution came from america to europe first through denmark, though of course important changes in beer culture had been going on for many years before that in the united kingdom and belgium as well, and norway already had its great pioneer n gne   since 2002.  yet, the pioneering role of denmark s capital in bringing american style  postmodern  craft brewing to europe can hardly be overestimated, and  lbutikken was a pioneer among pioneers.  among the beers  lbutikken commissioned for sale at the shop only was this blueberry lambic by cantillon:  lbutikken delivered the blueberries to the brewery in anderlecht, and there it was steeped in lambic in the same way as lambic brewers already traditionally did with cherries or raspberries.  as much as we now, fifteen years later, take this kind of thing for granted, back in 2005 this was anything but self-evident (even though cantillon was already one of the most progressive lambic producers back then also with less evident fruit species); so the result, simply called bl baer ( blueberry  in danish), was an important and influential beer, that helped to spark the renewed interest in not just cantillon s oeuvre, but traditional lambic in general.  since 2005, cantillon has been producing this bl baer (almost) every year in limited quantities, even after  lbutikken closed its doors   himmeriget took over the commissioning of bl baer from there   and it has become one of those iconic whales that are being traded for often hundreds of euros on the second-hand market.  i have been reading about it for fifteen years   and tried to obtain a bottle a few times without success   but only now i found myself in the opportunity to finally taste it, as cantillon is now selling bottles in their taproom in brussels.  had it from a 75 cl bottle, 2019 vintage.  densely mousy, medium thick but opening, pale lilac-tinged off-white head on a hazy, beautifully purple beer with carmine red tinge.  aroma of indeed obvious blueberry, as in actual blueberry juice as well as clear blueberry skins, also cooked blackberries, stewed rhubarb, very dry red wine, lemon juice, background impressions of damp cellar, wet old wood, rosehip tea, sweat.  very fruity onset, juicy sweetish and spicy blueberries galore, but in a slender, elegant way, tart but relatively mildly so, with lots of minerally effects on the sides, adding crispness and further elegance; soft bready  soil  under ongoing blueberry juiciness and fleshiness, with a soft blueberry skin astringency towards the end, where light woody and funky-bretty notes show up as well, though the soft sourness and fruitiness of the berries remains the dominant factor all the way through, with this ongoing minerally undertone accompanying it.  great fruit lambic as expected, and even if this may not be the most overwhelming cantillon lambic i had to date (implying that its high ratings everywhere have a lot to do with its sheer rarity as well), i very much enjoyed it because of its elegance, subtlety and balance   apart from, of course, the feeling that i just ticked another famous bucket list beer, which admittedly adds to the experience.  i would, however, not go out of my way to obtain a second-hand bottle for hundreds of euros either (even if i am still very curious about earlier vintages), but there is no denying that this is a beautiful beer that allows the blueberries (or, more accurately in the english language perhaps, 'billberries') to shine beautifully - connecting with denmark's traditional affinities with this and other kinds of forest fruit. nordic-themed lambic the way it was intended."

medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
finishes dry, medium wooden, a bit sweet a bit sour, with pears, apples, lingering blueberry skin, that stays forever. 

delicious! i really love the nose, which is an almost perfect, dense mix of funk and beautiful, thick blueberry notes. tastes a bit young maybe, with a slight acidic edge, but then also with loads of lovely blueberries. beatiful and pretty different, as great as i was hoping for!

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"2015 750ml bottle drunk 9/20/17.
a beautiful robe of violet-magenta shows good clarity in the light, leaving the plentiful sediment behind. pink-tinged white head shows modest retention for the style, eventually fading to ring.
the nose is just filled with beautifully expressive fruit, side-by-side with tart bacteria/yeast creating wonderful layers of complexity. sniffable to perpetuity, it's both tart, juicy, tannic and even somewhat vinous, yet never ""sweet"" or ""sugary"". nor is it too sour, achieving a good mix of both fruit and bacteria acid while lively brett adds band aid, light lime and other soft funk and mineral. no alcohol or flaw. very high strength of aroma.
similar fruit flavors abound, tickling the tongue as plentiful brett and lacto add a lightly puckering character and both fruit and barrel tannin soften the blow (though it's never terribly sour), mostly just very tart. the fruit is well-integrated again and the carbonation quite engaging, but it's markedly thin, seemingly over-attenuated and phenomenally bone dry, to the point of fault. it's pretty rare that under-malting and/or thin, washed out texture is a thing i get from cantillon (or 3f for that matter) so this was even more disappointing. just didn't have enough malt depth/suppleness. obviously i'm not expecting it to be sweet, thick and richly malty, but it was noticeably less than the standard and caused a lot of astringency to build up on the finish. assuming this is just a bottle or batch variation and still enthused to drink more blabaer."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottle -- immense thanks to rob for trading this one! this makes a pretty aggressive claim as soon as you pour it out -- it s purple/blue and gives off a powerful smell of funk, barnyard, and berries. i ve never had a bilberry before, but i ve spent enough time in new england to have eaten my weight in blueberries, and this has a truly unique flavor combination of true lambic funk and an earthy, fruity blueberry flavor. not as sweet or as sour as a lot of new-world fruited sours; this is instead a really balanced and complex fruited lambic. wow."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottles - 2011, 2014 and 2016, all had in the same vintage year. classic cantillon fruit lambic characteristics, with yeast, funk, lemon zest and acidic notes. blueberry shines through differently depending on the vintage, most prominent for me in the  16. feels a bit heavier on the palate than other cantillons like fou foune and their kriek, which gives it its own feel. top 3 cantillon for me!"

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"the often-mentioned animalic scents are also hand-picked for my skin, similar to this, you can find them in the beauty salons. used straw, cork, and the atmosphere of the house: give the wine the basic tone. all this accompanied by a vinegary cranberry sauce, smoothed over with notes of cherries, herbs, blackberries, red berries and cranberries. it opens up a complex world, with vibrant acidity and flavors, a wild and acrid floral aftertaste, a strong character, with a dry, dark and woody finish, and then with an unwashed road that can be analyzed for minutes, and on which the wild will and they don't even find a variety of songs with air buds that aren't used to notes. I wouldn't say anything to others, but I would have gladly discovered something extra deep. Of course, I understood the twist about the drink, but its home is in the world of imperial stouts."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"as always with lambics it smells like something the cat dragged in. the colour is purple and very beautiful.

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"huge thanks to docj007 yet again for the crazy beer he shares with us all. 375ml bottle from 2012.




pours deep reddish purple with a one and a half finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small webs of lace on the sides of the glass.




smells of sweet/tart fresh picked blueberries, the ever present cantillon musty brewery funk, some mild lactic sourness, yogurt and finally some grains. taste follows the same path with plenty of tart blueberries and lactic sourness up front followed closely by the must and finally the lightly chewy grains. feel is slightly grainy quickly being enveloped by plenty of musty sourness and slight sweetness from the berries.




overall an excellent fruit lambic. i still prefer a few of there others more but i would never turn down another chance to try this one. glad to finally get to try it, thanks again justin!"

excellent stuff from cantillon & easily the best of the albeit limited selection of lambics i ve tried so far. starting with a nice cherry & raspberries taste, the blueberries came through strong soon after & there was plenty funk/tart too. an excellent balance & great mouthfeel, the beer had a lingering sourness that stayed with you after each sip; excellent stuff & a must try if you can find it."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"(15 cl pour from tap @ himmeriget; 2015 vintage) served at fridge temperature but left to sit in the glass for ten minutes to properly appreciate the aroma. i ve long abstained from imbibing this beverage knowing that i haven t really developed a palate capable of appreciating spontaneously fermented beers that well. however, this offer was too good to pass on. the glass is a small footed tulip and the colour of the lambic is difficult to ascertain as the sun has set and we only have candlelights and weak spotlights by the bar. it does look like it has a syrah-like reddish purplish hue with a little head that is somewhat lighter. as you tilt the glass the beverage seems to draw little curtains of lace. good retention and regeneration. aroma seems to be mostly funk at this point at least when contrasted with the amorosa of similar vintage in the glass next to it. the funk seems to me to have soft notes of barnyard. on the palate the beverage strikes you as bone dry with a disciplined tart expression that seems rather  clean  and well-defined making it rather easy on the stomach. carbonation doesn t seem to play much of a role here. halfway through the glass and having swirled it once i manage to catch a hint of blueberry in the aroma but it s elusive. to be honest 15 cl was the perfect amount for me. enough to appreciate the experience while still leaving space to enjoy other beers."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"an absolutely wonderful beer. a smooth tartness with very balanced blueberry flavor complements. it's like popping a fresh blueberry in your mouth. it dances on your tongue and makes you wish it wasn't as rare as it is. no head and lightly carbonated. this beer was and treat. 

---rated via beer buddy for iphone"
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,had many of the vintages as i used to live right by there. usually pours a dark blue violet. quick reducing white head. aroma of ripe blueberries and then funk barnyard and old oak with some musty barnyard. great mouthfeel of initial fruit sweetness then dry and tart. the finish is earthy and leathery with blueberries present.
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"blabaer  15 vintage

pours a dark purple, ember red color, with a dark pink, small head. the head collapses immediately to a glass coating sheet of lacing, revealing tiny bubbles at its edge.

the nose reveals a great blend of funky barnyard, dusty malts and unripe blueberry skin. once the aromas open up, a ripe fruit tone becomes present, together with a mineralic quality, reminding of an actual fruit juice. its tartness is present enough though, to prevent the beer from becoming jam sweet, also due to a light note of wood bark, wet spruces and leather.

has a wonderful soft mouthfeel, while the beer reveals a lively, mineral accentuated carbonation, adding an utmost pleasant softness to its profound tartness.

blueberries become visible in a prickly, unripe way and turn sweeter, once earthy malts wrap up the beers tart qualities. berries don t get overly prominent on their own, but provide a great balance together with the present, pleasantly dry funkiness, ending with a ripe, wood accompanied, mellow sweetness. its finish exhibits a great range of intense flavors working together with the fruits, consisting of lemon zest, a mineralic softness and a note of old, soft cheese, highlighted by the fantastic mouthfeel.

a great beer with an authentic, well integrated fruit character, which goes hand in hand with the typical cantillon lambic sourness. still, the most outstanding aspect of this beer is its phenomenal soft mouthfeel."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"from  lbutikken. july 2015.
looks.. rich dark red/burgundy , the fast dissipating head is sml and is burgundy shaded white.
smells..blueberry and the skins, danky old sock farmyard, toe jam.. 
tastes.. bright and fruity blueberry, the cantillon lambic sourness is there at first but it goes away and leaves a real fresh tarty berry skin and flesh taste and mouthfeel. it s a little less carbonated and more juicy then other cantillon fruit blended beers."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottle thanks to justin! shared at my wedding on 9/12/15. pour was a gorgeous ruby color, purple hues, pink head that fizzled into nice lacing. aromas were of tart blueberry, medium barnyard funk, medium floral...notes of bread lingered with the hints of vanilla and oak. taste was absolutely delicious! big blueberry presence...more than i expected! although, the dose of funk was not what the nose suggested, the blend of tartness from the fruit/yeast pulled things together nicely. oak impressions gave vanilla, earth, under-ripe wine grapes and a bit of earth. finishes, semi-dry with a good pucker/final dose of blueberry. i have heard that the 2013 vintage is not up to par with the others.....and if this is the case, i can t wait to try this again!! thought it was spectacular and extremely well-balanced. a night i will not soon forget."

Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottle at franks (huge thanks to whoever brought this). pours a hazy golden orange-pink body with thin bubbly white lacing. nose is full of tart blueberry, citrus fruits, sour peach, fruit seeds, light jam/marmalade character and light sour bread. mouthfeel is wonderful -soft and light-bodied with medium tartness and light acidity; notes of tart blueberry pie, fruit skins, funk, sour citrus fruits, cherry pie, light cheesy flavor and soft mineral character. this is an incredibly perfected fruit lambic."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"a beautiful purple dress with an active pink foam, the nose is dusty, mineral and a touch of menthol. the cornflower struggles to break through in the first sips while the greenery dominates with its gently acidic tones. the more it opens, the more the cornflower expresses itself and the whole then becomes more suave."

(#1600) may 5, 2014, vintage 2013, bottle received in trade with dedollewaitor, thanks! 



pours ruby red with a frothy pinkish head. aroma is funky, soft citrus notes, barnyard, typical cantillon lambic with a layer of tart blueberries on top. taste is light tart, fruity blueberries, light sweet, medium dry with a smooth tart lasting finish. light to medium bodied with soft small bubble carbonation. 

8-4-8-4-17=41"
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"375 ml bottle from 2013. 
aroma is rather blueberry forward with background oak and barnyard funk. medium light acidity with hints of citrus. light phenolics. 
pours a slightly murky, purple red with a small pink head that quickly disappears to the edges. 
flavor is moderately acidic and slightly harsh. moderate blueberry character. light barnyard, earthy funk with a bit of oak. light medicinal phenolic character. 
mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium light carbonation. low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
overall, definitely one of my last favorite fruited lambics. blueberries just don t seem to work very well in beer and add an odd character to brett funk. it does get better as my palate adjusts to the blueberry."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"cool, color. very acidic. tastes a lot like every blueberry sour i have had. the fruit just comes off to me as a weird cheesy/farty/stale vanilla thing. this is a great sour beer... i just don t care for blueberry or boysenberry beers."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"this is the rating for the 2014 edition which is the best one i ve had, the other years i ve tried varies between 3.9 and 4.3.
very intense beer, you get that it s a cantillon right away, very fruity, but not overwhelmingly so - compared to for instance the mikkeller double blueberry, which is more like a perfect blueberry drink of fruitiness. this one has more edge, you get to taste parts of the blueberry you can t normally taste, but in this super exposed way you can. i love this one, feel grateful it comes out in my neighborhood every year."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"375 bolt 2013 - thanks to dedollewaitor! pours a full reddish/blue color with a berry colored head. the nose is blueberry, tart sour. the taste is tart blueberry, green apples, funk ending lightly sour with fruit rounding out. the body is light and slightly oily with very fine carbonation."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"many thanks to thirstybird for sharing!! 2013er batch. 
fruity-fresh nose with sourish hints. very smooth and fresh beginning. very soft. the typical cantillon-taste is there, also blue/red fruits (in the aftertaste you can figure the blueberries out), but the sourness is very low. tart-horse blanket aftertaste, fresh-smooth, soft and nice!!
--> very interesting brew, but not as deep or complex as i have thought!"
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"pours a deep ruby color with small pink foam. aromas of funk, oak, must, and mixed berry smoothie. the palate is sour and acidic, with flavors of slight oak, lemon, very light blueberry, lighter red fruit, tannin, and acid. finishes dry. i expected more blueberry in this one, but it s still an excellent beer."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"poured from the bottle into a tumbler glass at  ltibukken store in copenhagen denmark. vintage 2014, 375ml bottle.

big deep ruby red color like a gem. an absolute crystal clear gem, no hints of darker or lighter hues of different colors. shines crystal clear. a faint pink head dissolves with a little bit of suds, but even manages some carbonation while in a simple conical tumbler. one of the most impressive colors on any beer i have ever seen. doesn t get any better for a lambic.

fascinating aroma. bouquet fills with earth funky notes, slightly ashy but even more so with hints of garden mushroom and fresh tilled soil. fruit angle is all over and surprisingly varied. blueberries of course but also sour cherry, raspberry, even peach like fuzz which works out amazingly.

the first sip is exquisite. while the fruit comes nicely with funky aromas, there is a great melding sweetness of balsamic vinegar to match. it s as if it is drizzled all over a salad bowl filled with fruits of cherry, blueberry and so forth. great funk acid tones on this, with much of the earthy bouquet matching nicely. 

everything is incredibly balanced with wild yeast taking the first notes, and fruit following with sweet acidic tones. not quite rodenbach sweetness but unique all it s own. extremely complex and balanced. the feel even for a lambic, does come off a little less impressive. depth in malt even comes across light, but the flavors easily push through. fun carbonation. hinting at light seltzery qualities but never getting there from a large palate that is complex

what more needs to be said? a great lambic, probably the best blueberry beer of any style by far i have ever had. not my favorite cantillon, but does this get any better? no, unequivocally not even close."
Cantillon Blåbær Lambik,3.3,"bottle, vintage 14 @  lbutikken, k benhavn. pours dark red with a small short lived head. aroma is tart and funky, with plenty of berries, as well as horseblanket and some apple cider vinegar. full body with very soft carbonation. flavour is nice and fruity sourish with apple cider vinegar, blueberries and blackcurrants, as well as some funky fruitiness. fabulous everlasting berry tartness in the finish."

Bellwoods Brettal Head Foeder Aged Pale Ale (2020-),3.5,"wild ale by this craft brewery in toronto, bottle from geers shared with craftmember.  thick and frothy, cobweb-lacing, snow white, medium sized head on a misty deep yellow golden beer, turning cloudy but equally golden with sediment.  aroma of strong bretanomyces, ranging from damp hay, wet leather and moist jute to stale urine, armpit sweat and goat stable, next to impressions of sourdough, moldy lemon, sorrel leaf, green plum and apple peel.  fruity onset, softly but consistently sour with this ongoing lemony edge, surrounding notes of unripe nectarine and green gooseberry, lively carbonated; sourdoughy core, white bread, with this lemon effect gently lingering at the edges, acting quite refreshing.  very prominent retronasal brett funkiness, wet leather, jute and goat all over again, blending with a grassy hop bitter note which manages not to overrule that delicate lemon effect persisting till the last drop.  very brett-forward - as is to be expected from a beer named 'brettal head' - but with more sourness than expected so i assume the barrels harboured a microflora of lactic and other bacteria as well; not too complex for this type of beer and perhaps a tad less of that sourness and more hop bitterness could have elevated it a bit to another level, but it does its trick well.  no complaints at all - and i hasten to add that my sample was already nine months past its 'best before' date, so pregnant with funky, barnyard-y, sweaty brett effects which may be less outspoken when young."

Knoblach Hell,3.5,"I bought the light garlic beer in a Euro bottle from Landbierparadies24. It looks good in the glass and has not only bready aromas but also protein-rich aromas in the nose. But that could be due to the last hot summer, which generally led to higher protein levels in grains. It is nice and fresh on the first sip - almost too much carbonation. The protein and bread aroma really hits you again on the finish - too much for me. We are obviously not dealing with a classy, ​​slim light beer, but rather with a traditional, rustic beer."
Knoblach Hell,3.5,"The light beer from Knoblach is a strong golden yellow with a cloudy, creamy foam. Light, bready notes dominate the scent, and floral hop notes can be discovered in the distance. The light beer from Knoblach starts off malty and slightly floral. A restrained sweetness dominates the scene, but a fine, now grassy, ​​slightly bitter hop is also noticeable right from the start. The optimally dosed carbon dioxide ensures a subtle and certainly not too lively tingle, and the resulting creamy and yet tangy mouthfeel is truly fun. The fruit notes that gradually develop tend towards apple and lemon. With unmistakable hop bitterness and a sweet malt aroma, the light beer from Knoblach finishes slightly robust and absolutely harmonious. All in all, a really successful light one."

Salopian Polygraph,3.5,"330ml bottle from les crepes de sophie, shrewsbury. only just realised i haven t rated this, despite consuming quite a few of these, so of course i had to crack open another for rating purposes. pours thick oil black with a wonderfully large treacle brown head that stays defiant til the end. aroma is prickly pine giving a hint of the hoppy influence to follow. grapefruit pith, smooth roast malts and a coarse pine-coated bitterness all fight for your attention as you marvel at how powerfully elegant it looks in the glass. this is a beast of a drink."
Salopian Polygraph,3.5,"330ml bottle @ home on 12th feb 2014.

i couldn t decide what to pour it into, so chose a chimay chalice in the end: it looked fine. rich, deep foaming head of lovely tanned, creamy bubbles, sat on top of a jet black body, the creamy topping stayed around for the whole drink, shrinking in size, but staying the distance intact.

intense bitter hop aroma somehow seeps through the creamy head, coffee smells within a malty base come later as the beer warms a little.

the taste is a coffee/chocolate infused bitter hop monster: dark bourneville chocolate soaked in over roasted malts, deep and malty, yet with an overriding hop bitterness.

the huge blend of flavours almost hide the alcohol content, but not quiet.

body is smooth and nearly creamy in nature, but it s more robust than that and the hop content gives some nice rough edges and a final bite."
Salopian Polygraph,3.5,"1) bottle from beer gonzo, coventry quaffed live@the new penguin. entered 03/02/14. pours glossy pitch with a huge, cratering beige foam. beautiful us imperial aroma reminiscent of neopolitan ice cream and after eight mints sprinkled with cigar ash. deep luxurious body awash with high-end bitter chocolate, after eight mint,  juicy tropical hop; pineapple, blueberry undercurrents, shot of espresso, patchouli, pina colada-with-a-cigar. i m not selling it, but it s rounded, deep and beautiful like the majority of salopian s output, with a pacific hop character that doesn t diminish it s blackened heart and quintessential stoutiness. not bloody bad. 848417. 
2) wow. from first sip clearly one of the best beers i've had in a while. bottle from gonzo. nose a juicy concoction of liquorice, filter coffee dregs, anise, belgian devilry and blackcurrant. you could believe there was some kind of perfumed peel, seed or grains in there. but there aren't. mouth filling tar pour lidded densely with beige. outrageous flavour dangerous with blackcurrant and orange rind hop undercurrents distracting entirely from the reality of alcohol. rich, raisiny cocoa, burnt fennel seed, blistered red pepper and mellow wreaths of cigar vying for prominence. a mg of marmite on burnt toast with jam. but it's that lush blackcurrant and blueberry character poured over with chocolatey cafeti re bottoms that wins out. one of those rare ones you just don't want to end.

Salopian Polygraph,3.5,"bottle from appleyard s deli, shrewsbury. black body with a tan head. as other have said, this is really a black ipa rather than an imperial stout as it has lots of hop flavour over the malts. it starts off quite creamy with coffee and chocolate before some bitter pine hops notes. the alcohol is warming and very pleasant. nice stuff."
Salopian Polygraph,3.5,"bottle from beermoth, manchester. just about black. milky coffee coloured, tight, lasting head. ripe blackcurrant. grapefruit juice. dark, sweet malt. taste is thick, dark, caramel malt sweetness. then a massive, grapefruit, dry, pithy bitterness kicks in and gives it some posh. this is a black ipa, not an imperial stout. and a very good black ipa, at that."

Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"oktoberfestbier is basically a somewhat lighter (less malty) offspring of the old m rzen, and this one is apparently even sold abroad as an oktoberfestbier, even though ayinger does not belong to the six breweries officially licensed to serve their beer at the legendary oktoberfest.  i assume this one is made in the same style, but i have half a liter to find out.  thick and dense, frothy, foamy, egg-white, cobweb-lacing, stable head on a clear (filtered), warm pale 'metallic' amberish-glowing old-golden robe with steady sparkling in the middle.  aroma of dry crackers, lightly toasted white bread, hint of dry caramel, some old dried thyme, dried apple peel, slight petrichor, a whiff of banana faraway, wet granite, something very faintly smoky (wet cigarette tobacco) or even meaty (chicken stock).  malt-fruity onset, clean and rounded, softish in carb, smooth and slick; vague hints of red apple, pear and banana pop up but very superficially and briefly so.  cracker- and cereal-like malt sweet body with a thin caramelly edge, even something vaguely peanutty, with a pleasant minerality running underneath; lightly herbal hops grace a quenching finish, in which this minerality comes to the foreground even more.  hints of dried field flowers and fresh chamomile linger retronasally while the maltiness, remaining sweetish, rounded and cereally, maintains its fullness and purity.  trusted aying does not disappoint: this is indeed a somewhat 'slimmer' and leaner version of classic m rzen, perfectly fit to celebrate the oktoberfest tradition - it actually tastes as if it were served next to the oktoberfest beers of paulaner, augustiner, l wenbr u and the others.  recommended for those who like clean, 's ffiges', smooth and pure german lagers."
Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"july 2024. 500ml dark bottle, filtered, from lcb. drunk chilled from the fridge. though a lager, and though drunk cold straight from the fridge, and though drunk two weeks after bbe (and lagers, because the sugar - which assists vintage beers - has been fermented out, are not beers to keep - they are beers to drunk fresh), actually tastes good. there is a malty, chewy character here which is quite pleasing.  these german march or october festival beers (brewed in march, stored/fermented over the summer, then drunk in october at festivals) can be quite malty and sweet, with low hop flavour (hops don't age well, but high abv helps keep a beer, which is why these march beers tend to be a little stronger than the everyday german lagers). a marzen is best drunk at room temperature when the malt flavours can be appreciated. but i popped mine in the fridge, because it's old, and an old lager can be bitter and astringent. anyway, it's a nice beer. yeah, slightly old and bitter, especially as it starts to warm up, but with just enough caramel notes to keep me happy. not a great beer, but certainly a decent one.  hacker-pschorr oktoberfest m rzen, camba bavaria m rzen, and hofbr u m nchen oktoberfestbier are my three highest rated proper marzens, and they are not exactly rated high, so i don't regard it as a great beer style, but it is one of the better lagers, and would be great fun drunk at a german beer festival in october.

With a lush, fine-pored and stable head, it is perfectly depicted on an amber-colored, glossy beer. The smell of chestnuts completely dominates the beer. The honey only plays a minor role. Only slightly sweet on the first sip from the honey with the omnipresent chestnut. Highly bubbly with little drinking resistance. A top-class m rzen if you like chestnuts."

Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"Visually, it is a beautiful amber colour with light yellow-orange reflections. The white, fine-pored head is fluffy and stable and lasts very well.
The aroma is slightly spicy, dry fruity, woody and reminds one a little of the brown shell of chestnuts.
The first sip is very soft and fresh, already has a lovely caramel flavour, but not too heavy. Very nice caramel on the palate, without being too sweet. The chestnut-like, woody spiciness goes perfectly with it. The somewhat subtle, slightly grainy malt aroma is very typical for Rayinger - but that also makes this beer unmistakable. The delicate, slightly bitter hop note is very classy and holds back, but complements the overall picture very well. Incredibly well composed and extremely full-bodied! drinking pleasure, mouthfeel and sweetness are unbelievable!

The aroma lasts very well in the finish and lingers for a long time. The only delicate bitter notes come from the roasted aromas - but a beer like this should not and must not be too bitter.

What is left to say... this beer's aroma and caramel character are more reminiscent of a Viennese lager than an average Bavarian Märzen. But yes... where does a Bavarian Märzen end and a Viennese lager begin? This beer is definitely incredibly good and definitely falls into the ""extraordinary"" category!"

Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"amber pour with two fingers of fluffy tan head. strong carbonation with a continuous stream of tiny bubbles rising to the top of the glass. aroma is sweet caramel, with nutty notes and light brown sugar. flavor offers loads of bread and biscuit malt up front. touches of honey and caramel are pleasantly balanced with grassy hop notes and some straw lager notes. finally, this finishes with a surprising twist - a rather nice dryness that almost evaporates on the tongue. the finish lingered for awhile, allowing the alcohol warmth to swell. light creaminess in the mouthfeel. hops here are understated and you won't really pay much attention to them, but do play an important role in tying the brew together. a tasty oktoberfest that focuses on a clean recipe. what makes this one unique from other oktoberfests is the dry finish. better than many of the huge number of oktoberfests out there. quite distinct and tasty festival lager. this should be a go-to session beer in fall."

9/7/2020 - thankfully, knowing beers, i gave this german one another try.  so much better than the usa ""craftie"" overhopped messes.  this beer tasted much more like i would expect a german marzen to taste.  hops?  yes, but a taste, not a 150 lb bag per bottle usa craftie mess. the malt is first, as an octoberfest should be (by definition) and tastes great.  the hops complements the malt and adds a tasteful edge to the beer.  but, it doesnt overpower and effectively destroy the beer - as is the case with 99.99999% of usa ""craftie"" over hopped messes.

Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"the pour is clean with a few bubbles among the light amber color and a slightly off-white, thick head that gathers on top without much lacing. the aroma is sweet, with a hint of sour. the feel is lightly carbonated and very light. we finally get a to the flavor and it's incredible smooth with a slightly malty taste kicking in towards the end just to remind you that it's a m rzen. i find it very smooth to drink and favorable among lighter beer drinkers, but it's not for me. i feel like it needs more texture and flavors. considering its above average price, i'm very dissapointed."

Ayinger Festmärzen,2.9,"marzen is not my favorite style, but i did like this one. very subdued, refreshing flavor, similar to an amber beer. i'm not a big fan of very sweet malt and bread flavor of most marzen beers, so i do appreciate this take on it."

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Reserve 2021 Blanton's,4.2,"about as over the top as a bourbon county stout can be, with an aroma, taste and body that is better than any from the chicago goosers. with the colonel at my side, a tried and true blanton's aficionado, we judged the nose to contain coffee, chocolate, bourbon, oak, dates and raisins. the appearance was a thin yet lacy head, but a bonus point comes forth from the packaging and the delightful little horse bottle stopper mimicking that from a blanton's bourbon bottle (alas--there's no letter on the stopper so i'm not challenged to find another seven to spell out b-l-a-n-t-o-n-s). the taste was smashingly sweet without being the least bit heavy or syrupy. it genuinely came across as a stout that had spent an inordinate amount of time in a barrel, yet emerged the better for it. poured from a bottle just shy of two years from its filling date, july 25, 2021."

first time trying a bba beer along with the bourbon who's barrels made it. the bourbon smells rather bright, more alcoholic for sure. the beer still has nice noses of chocolate and vanillin from barrel char. beer is black, a viscous edge around the glass with a very few bubbles visible (it was opened and stoppered a month ago). the bourbon has strong alcohol, burns going down. the beer taste is actually minimal on bourbon taste. it's alcoholic, yes, but without the burn of a 90+ proof liquor. instead smoothed by the roasted stout malts."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"bottle. pours dark like midnight with a beige head and aromas of chocolate and topsoil. flavor is very nice... a huge punch of cocoa powder right off the bat and then a transition to abv heat and tingly hops... kind of resiny, i guess. very nicely put together and balanced."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"rich deep dark brown coloured body with an almost fully opaque black glow along with some lighter brown when held at an angle, all with a nice, and easy-going three centimetre tall rich brown head on top. about 90% opaque and very nice! full-bodied; very rich hoppy flavour at first with a dose of resin, pine and herbs at first with a huge malt backbone, bunches of roast and a dose of caramelised sugars that makes this very complex throughout. aftertaste is almost all roasted malt, with some lactose, alcohol, vanilla, cream, bright grassy and resinous hops and a dose of resin on the end - very nice and incredibly potent. overall, seemingly more alcohol than 9,00% and definitely not a  black ipa , this should be categorised as a baltic porter, as if you had this in a blind test, you d say its more of okocim porter (with extra hops) than most  average  black ipas. that said, it s a great beer, that i m happy to drink [relatively] fresh and get from my home state. i sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from grape vine in sterling heights, michigan on 09-december-2016 for us$2,99 sampled at home in washington on 11-may-2017."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"the appropriately named goodnight bodacious is one big ass beer. coal-black pour with a rich layer of suds. earthy, piney, and roasty smells. somehow the flavor manages to be both hugely malty and hugely hoppy. scorched earth, bitter chocolate, charred coffee beans, and citrus. full-bodied and boozy. drinking this on the middle of a cloudy day proved to be somewhat stupid. this thing had me ready for a nap."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"bottle: &nbsp black, soft frothy sandy head, spotty lacing. &nbsp faint roastiness, subtle hops. &nbsp nice

ashy notes follow. &nbsp moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp i like this in that its not acrid, isn t balanced one 

way or the other, and has a bit of sweetness to it. &nbsp seems like a solid example."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"overall not bad, but nothing that really stood out to me here. good chocolate notes, but i tend to like the more dry versions of this style. worth a try."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"bottle, pours black with medium off white head that stuck around for a minute or so. faded to a ring of foam with nice lace. notes are rye, roasty malt, chocolate, wood, coffee, light ash and bitter hops. the roast overpowers the hops slightly but its well balanced overall for a black ipa. surprised i was able to finish most of the bottle before cracking a can of boat."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"bottle to pint. pours very black with brown around the edges. pours like a stout. aromas of cedar, barnyard and almost a sweet burnt rubber. the body is medium with good carbonation. good toast notes. coffee is the predominant flavor on the palate with a nice bitterness at the end from the hops. there is a strong alcohol component at the end. the finish is slightly dry. which is welcoming. overall a very nice beer. i could drink a few of these."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"12 bottle shared by willrunforbeer, much thanks. black with almost no head. aroma is chocolate, charred malt and pine.

full bodied, somewhere between oily and creamy texture; a very long finish with both sweet malt, roasted flavors and bitter hops on the finish.

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,outstanding beer. perfect palate on this ipa. hops and roast come through well. finish is a bit high on the alcohol. great overall.
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,this is an interesting beer. its like a mix between a strong ale - very malty - and an ipa - very hoppy. its a weird mix and i m not entirely sure what they were going for with it.
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"this beer tastes expensive. malty as hell and hoppy..... as hell also... smells like barbecue, and tastes like a million bucks. i normally hate black ipas, but this one is great... goodnight bodacious, if by bodacious you mean me because it s really strong and they don t say how strong it is but it s delicious so you drink like 4 and then you die.... because shorts want to change the face of alcohol..... from booze to death... goodnight bodacious..."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,pleasant aroma. poor s dark with a thin head. hops are present but not overwhelming. i m not a huge black ipa fan but i place this at or near the top in that category.
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"fresh bottle. pours black with a slim khaki head. nice hop aroma is most noticeable first, then roasted malts, a touch of chocolate. taste is a nice balance of roasted malts, ""earthy"" hops (for lack of a better word), and slight coffee. medium+ bitterness. full bodied, average carbonation, almost creamy mouthfeel with a lingering bitterness. well done."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"imperial black ipa but tastes more like a strong stout with a lot of bitterness. the aroma is stout, I didn't feel too many hops but the beer had already settled down. in taste just as much roastiness, chocolate and dark fruits plus suddenly a lot of citrus bitterness. the beer is thick and beautiful."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,on tap...overwhelming sweetness dominates here with a syrupy molasses character. lacks balance...i wouldn t have another one of these.
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"very tasty drinkable black ipa, high ibu and also well malted. very good drinkability."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"extra from brandon. thanks man. i used to be a big black ipa fan. but lately they have gotten boring. kinda hoppy, too much rye. all similar. but every once in a while you get woken up, and this was it. lots of chocolate malt that perfectly blends with a nice helping of pine hops. the body is a touch thicker and creamier than most of this style and abv but works great."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"had on-tap at boatworks and served in a shaker pint.

appearance: black. finger of dark brown head. great lacing, (4/5)

smell: excellent mix of hops and roasted malt... fruity and earthy hops one whiff, roastiness the next. really nice stuff that i like. doesn t blow me away, but great balance for the style. (3.75/5)

taste/feel: on point. excellent. phenomenal blend of sweetness and bitterness that make this a brew to remember. again, plenty of nice hoppiness coupled with chocolate and roastiness. could you ask for much more? the brew is also nice and full in feel with a medium carbonation. very nice. (4.25/5, 4.5/5)

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"12 oz. bottle from blowofftube. pours dark brown to black in color with a small khaki colored head. the aroma and flavor have roasted malts, coffee, spicy notes and some chocolate with some earthy, piney and citrus hops mixed in. probably a bit malt forward, but does have a decent bitterness to the finish."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"color: black, opaque even under the light. beige foam, medium bubbles, not very abundant, quickly falling. low carbonation. 

aroma: chocolate, slightly roasted, characteristic of dark salts in combination with hoppy. very pleasant and tempting. 

taste: dry, sweet at the end, turning into bitter. accents of dark chocolate and alcohol. to warming. after a while, a sourness appears, characteristic of using a large dose of dark salts. 

fantastic beer. short s brew proves once again that it offers really interesting proposals. it is a downright oily dark IPA for calm sipping. the aroma contained in it cannot get boring. the taste is equally great. the rating would be higher if not for the price. I think that a 0.33 l bottle shouldn't cost more than PLN 15, which is already a lot of money."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,12 bottle crushed with honkeybra. pours pitch black with zero head. pretty under-carbonated. very dark malts make this incredibly astringent. gets borderline ash tray. the dark malt overpowers the hops a bit too much. more like a hoppy stout than a black ipa.
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"brown pour, tan head. way too malt forward for me. the hops are lost in a roasted malt and sweeter finish. meh."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"pours an oily black, pretty opaque. very thin butterscotch head. medium to low carbonation. hard to see the bubbles being so dark. aromas of coffee, and roasted nut. some hops creep in, giving an earthy undertone. taste is very malt-forward, imo. thick, oily coffee and roasted nut. a nice rich mouthfeel. some bittering hops lend pine, earth, floral notes and a dash of spice to the moderately dry finish. pretty decently done, but close to the the stout/porter end of the spectrum."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"pours jet black. little to no head. aroma is of mostly roasted, chocolate malts. not much, if any detection of hops. taste is on the chocolate malty side, with some slight citrus hop coming though. average beer. nothing great, but not bad either."
Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"lots of malt upfront. flavors of creamy dark chocolate and lightly roasted coffee leading to citrus hops, orange, citrus peel, caramel and hints of toffee. very well balanced and a great take on the style."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"aroma initially very good, salty, hoppy (fruity), chocolate-coffee, after some time a smell appears, which reminds me of cooked vegetables (leek, celery, kohlrabi), so it's probably dms. 
brown foam finely bubbled, leaves not very nice bushes on the glass. 
in taste you can feel burnt, sweet, a bit of chocolate and coffee, the beer is quite dry and has low carbonation, after the appearance of the above-mentioned dms, I don't feel the taste too much. 
I expected a bit more bitterness, but it is quite high and pleasant. 
generally speaking, the beer would be very good if not for this dms."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"12oz bottle. thanks sean! caramelized molasses, a bit of good earthy compost tea, and tangerine. interesting, this starts out with all the hallmarks of a black ipa, the sinamar cocoa powder and cola, the light brisk freshness of hops, but then, the hops never really materialize. i would call this a low to moderately hopped beer. for a black ipa, this is a pretty good american baltic porter, without as much caramel malt depth as it should have. very warming. it s a little confused and really needs to turn the hops up if its going to call itself a double black ipa."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"big thanks to a good buddy for scoring this for me. pours completely black with a slowly forming toffee-mocha head that settles slowly leaving some soapy lace behind. nose of deep dark chocolate, pine forest, resin, tropical fruit, very light roasted malt notes, maybe some molasses. taste is initially pretty sweet but then quite bitter. heavier bodied, full, slick, oily, viscous, creamy, bright with hoppiness, softer on the carb, with a very long hoppy and chocolaty bitter finish. this, to me, is the perfect black ipa. the hops and malts mesh perfectly, and i love the combination of the dark chocolate flavors with the hoppy bitterness. amazing."

Short's Goodnight Bodacious,4.5,"12oz bottle. courtesy of derek for this... pours deeper cherrywood reddish stouty pout, lesser intense at the eyes and topped with a thin film of medium khaki head... aroma of a pure smooth amalgamation of piney citrus fruity profile while still being equally measured with a moderate cocoa roast forwardness. both seem to balance each other nicely... favors are equally the same with more of a solid earthy body offering. hops stand tall but intermingle well with the roasted cocoa notes. a lot more balanced than a lot of the darker ipas seem to be. a touch boozy and phenolic on the backend but solid all around where there is a nice balance between malt and hops - big but a nice flavor profile nonetheless."

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"2015 bottle. age turns this beast into a gentle yet massive malt bomb, overflowing with sticky caramel decadence on top of a spicy, oak-laden rye back. starts sweet, stays sweet, yet finishes with an easygoing booziness belying the huge abv. probably wouldn t want to let it sit much longer, but 12-18 months is just about right."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"bottle from beaumont.a: dark burned caramel in color with a cappuccino head. lacing.n: huge licorice and anise. enormous barrel with a bit of caramel and vanilla along with a big peppercorn spice and oak. toffee, severely burnt brown sugar. rubbing alcohol.t: astringently bitter. sweet. burnt.m: medium-heavy sticky body, biting carbonation, huuuuuge alcohol.o: not half bad when you get used to it. never gets half good though. just too abrasive; maybe another year or three will tone it down. edit: knocking off .4 points because it?s a 20 dollar beer i drain-poured before i finished 5 oz. what a waste."

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"pours a rather unappealing muddy reddish with no head. there ends any criticism of this amazing beer. nose is cream, dry dark fruit, a little pepper, yeast, vanilla, rye. there is an interesting spiciness. very sweet initially quite malty. this is a lie - it becomes very dry later and rather powerfully bitter. heavy, oily mouthfeel. lingering heat in the throat. astringent at the end. lots of booziness. a tour de force."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"pours a very dark reddish brown color with small head. aroma is caramel, toffee, sugarcane, molasses, dark stone fruit, bitter floral hops, warm booze. taste is more mellow than the aroma but identical, caramel, sugarcane, molasses are heavy, with stone fruit body and hops and booze finish. in the nose you smell none of the rye aging but in the taste you get a ton of vanilla and smooth oak in the booze finish. wonderful beer, definitely worth trying but tough to justify the price versus the typical arrogant bastard for more than one."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"double bastard is one of my favorite beers ever, and templeton rye is my favorite whiskey. i ve been anxious to try this since i first saw it last year, but in my area the price has been ridiculous. after a certain point, somewhere north of twenty-five bucks for 500 ml, i just refuse to indulge the brewer and distributor. but when i visited the stone taproom in richmond recently i had the opportunity to purchase this beer at a much more reasonable price. it s wonderful, and the rye barrel aging is a a huge element of the character, but regular double bastard is so good that i don t see me buying this again. like regular double bastard, this beer pours brown with very little head. the aroma is all the stuff from regular double bastard... caramel, apples, brown sugar, spice. that s all in the flavor, plus the boozy blast of double bastard is compounded here. where i really notice the templeton barrel aging is in the aftertaste. on the aftertaste the distinct, spicy, sweet, oaky, buttery quality of templeton is a real, undeniable presence. no denying that this is a great beer. it just isn t better than double bastard already is."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"amber with off white head - malt, vanilla and some wood in the aroma - mlat body with some herbal notes, sweet vanilla, and wood flavours - the malt, wood and vanilla with hints of herbs goes into the finish - this was real good"
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"pours a hazy, muddy amber color, almost like an unfiltered cider. 1-finger bone-colored head that disappeared quickly. it has the grapefruit hops note that is expected for the brand, but with prominent notes of whiskey and wood mixed in. full body, lightly oily. astringent dryness to the finish. grapefruit hops flavor, with a caramel note. notes of vanilla, wood and whiskey show as it warms."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"a bit pricey at $20/500 ml, but good beer nonetheless. the barrels are evident. aroma is a bit sweeter with more toffee and vanilla tones apparent. flavor is still that bitter in your face taste of db. the rye aging adds and additional dry and extra bitter finish. not necessarily a pretty beer but what ba beer is? big beer that goes down without a fight. i like it a lot."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"bottle - 500ml corked and caged. 2015 vintage. dark amber to near brown pour. murky clarity. short foamy tan head. aroma is boozy and spicy with caramel, faded hops and citrus.taste is caramel, spicy rye, booze, light oak, hops, toasted dark bread, light fruit and sweet malt notes. body is medium with a dense, moderate carbonation and a moderate boozy warmth. ends with more booze, caramel, hops, citrus notes, sweet malt, bigger oak and spicy rye."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"bottle 2015 : pour is mahogany , with an a one finger beige head into this glass. it retains on the average side of things, with light spotting presence. the nose has a bit of familiarity to it - that heavy dose of dark fruits and tropicals from the double bastard. there s some alcohol and barrel notes here. the flavor profile is more complicated - it s perhaps over bittered from the pine hops, and a touch boozy. tropical notes mesh with caramel and burnt sugars. coconut and macaroons couple with whiskey notes. i m on the fence on this one. i m a fan of the bitter simplicity of double bastard, but this one seems to tread into the slightly annoying category - as far as drinking more than just a bit."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"500ml bottle, huge thanks to jan! pours dark reddish brown with a smooth head. aroma of whisky, caramely malty, syrup, vanilla, oak, wood, toffee, hops, rye and hints of ripe fruits. taste is heavy, sweetish and malty with loads of whisky, oak, toffee, some nuts, syrup, wood, rye and caramel. finish is hoppy, malty and caramely with some resin, whisky, oak, wood, vanilla, rye and hints of syrup, long lasting bitterness. heavy and complex, quite tasty."

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,500ml corked and caged bottle pours with a murky amber colored body that supports a tan head of foam. the aroma offers up pine hop nuanced vanilla and whiskey notes with a mild fruity ester sensation in the background. as it warms the whiskey odor starts to dominate. the taste delivers a big malt sweetened hit of whiskey and vanilla oak notes followed quickly by resiny pine hop bitterness. into the finish a pleasing earthy tea note is noticed in spite of the roaring whiskey and pine hops. this attains some balance although a bit of a softer barrel character would help.

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,cloudy appearance. reddish brown color. thick head with minimal lacing. a danky caramel aroma. honey smell. sugary. smells like a crispy cream doughnut. bittering tartness to the finish. thin texture. very dank. leaves a gag reflex in the throat. definite alcohol taste. finish sticks on the palate well after the drink. i do get a little tart grapefruit. i am somewhat dissappointed. my expectations were to high. dang it.
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"Thank you Simon for sharing this bottle! A very red liquid, very clear and with a semblance of foam that disappears very quickly. A rich and sweet nose where I note a lot of barley sugar and brown sugar. The barrel aging is omnipresent in this beer which, even young, lets out notes of madre. The rye is very powerful here, both in its alcoholic dimension and in its spicy aromas in general. On the palate, we immediately recognize the arrogant bastard strain of the beer. When you know this arrogant bastard, you recognize him right away! The beer has clearly undergone very intense raw hopping because a very strong bitterness hits me from the first sip. These hops blend quite skillfully in the barrel in alcoholic notes of caramel and barley sugar."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"bottle. it poured a hazy brown color with a tan head. the aroma was of whiskey, vanilla, oak and toffee. the taste was similar to the aroma with more whiskey, vanilla, toffee and caramel. quite good."

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,@ basunen 16-2-27: r tt nice with clear barrel and caramel. a lot of s t bourbon and candy sugar.
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"500ml bottle poured into a snifter.

3.25 a: opaque copper plum color. about 1/2 a finger of frothy beige head formed. retention is poor but appropriate from such a big beer. no lacing left.

4.0 s: what we have here is barrel forward with a base beer that can handle it. spicy, earthy whisky with leathery notes. plum, fig, rum raisins fruits. toffee and caramel maltiness. melon, vanilla, and oak. can t really pick up any hop notes as the barrel and malts are pretty aggressive.

3.75 t: much maltier than the nose suggests. lots of toffee and caramel. also plenty of the fruits mentioned above. the barrel also brings the above flavors, but also a tannic astringency that reminds me of drinking whiskey neat. despite the malts being pretty potent, the barrel makes this come off as drier.

3.75 m: heavy body. good moderate carbonation. sticky with decent creaminess.

3.75 d: pretty good overall. the barrel could be a bit better integrated, but it s still okay.

Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"pours a dark copper/chestnut brown color with deep mahogany edges and a one finger yellowish-beige head that quickly settles into a thin ring. decent retention, lasting through half of the pour with some spotty lacing left behind. 

the aroma of this beer is somewhat bland until it sits for a while and really has a chance to open up. after it warms, there is a decent barrel presence with charred oak, spicy rye and subtle spirit. underneath, there a decent malt presence but the complexity, especially the interesting hop profile, of the base beer is missing in the nose. more virgin oak than rye whiskey presence with only spicy rye and not much whiskey. also, lacking in depth usually associated with barrel aged beers. sweet caramel malts with slight leathery character. some caramel, toffee, tobacco and vinous dark fruit sweetness. kind of disappointing compared to other beers in this series. 

thankfully this beer is much more complex and flavorful than the aroma suggests. there s a really nice rye whiskey barrel presence that s naively integrated into the well balanced flavor profile of the base beer. again, there s some deeply charred oak but it s not as burnt/toothy as i expected. in addition there s a very nice rye whiskey flavor that isn t harsh, boozy or overpowering. delicate spirit with spicy rye, toasted coconut and a touch of marshmallow. this is countered mid palate by a complex malt bill and dank, earthy hop bitterness that lingers into the finish. hints of leather and tobacco followed by caramel, hazelnut and dark fruit sweetness. somewhat vinous with date, raisin, fig and dark berries followed by grassy resins and dry, piney bitterness. complex, well balanced with an extremely well masked abv. i never would have guessed it was 12.7%! overall, this beer smells pretty bland and isn t much to look at but the integration of barrel flavors is really impressive. another solid entry in this series."
Arrogant Double Bastard Ale in the Rye,3.8,"pours translucent sepia with a fairly thick and fine light tan head. aroma presents caramel, toasted malt, woody, whisky and nutty tones. flavor features bold roast malt, caramel, whisky, wood, and even fresh hop notes for a distinctive and very satisfying brew. mouthfeel has good body, if not much fizz. when a bastard meets a bastard comin  thro the rye--"

Fremont Rusty Nail,4.3,"black with a brown head - dark malt aroma with wood and some spicy notes - dark malt body with wood, spicy cinnamon , some hints of smoke and some alcohol heat in the back - the dark malt , wood , spicy smoke goes into the finish - this was good"
Fremont Rusty Nail,4.3,"pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fluffy, dark-brown head. smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and a huge cinnamon aroma that drowns out almost everything else except for a distinct bourbon note, as well as hints of chocolate, vanilla and licorice managing to poke through. taste is a decent balance of slightly smoked and roasted, quite caramelly malt and a huge, sweet cinnamon presence, although the flavor manages just a bit more depth than the nose, with more distinct chocolate, licorice, molasses and dark fruit notes of raisin and fig coming through here, with a good, not too boozy, bourbon character and hints of vanilla, tobacco and charred oak. finishes rather sweet, with a very light bitterness and some cinnamon, licorice and bourbon lingering in the aftertaste. full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

after ba dark star this is another big disappointment from fremont for me, which i had also been saving for a special occasion, just like the former. similar to ba abraxas, which i also consider highly overrated, this is a total cinnamon bomb that is way too sweet for my personal taste and just lacking overall balance, while the mouthfeel, while very nice, is hardly outstanding either in my personal opinion. although it does make for a very rich brew with a good bourbon presence that never turns quite as boozy as ba dark star, the sweetness from the cinnamon, licorice and molasses is just too much and while there is a decent complexity to this, most of it gets drowned out by the overly dominant cinnamon character that the lightly smoked/roasted malts and mild bitterness are really struggling against, while the dark fruits and vanilla only add to that overdone sweetness here. i'm not saying it's a bad brew, being quite rich and with a good complexity, mouthfeel and bourbon presence, just not that well balanced for my personal taste, being way too sweet and dominated by the cinnamon, while i would have wished for the smoked/roasted malt and bitterness to shine through more distinctly here."

Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,"golden ale from michigan flavoured with coffee - an unlikely ingredient perhaps in blonde beer styles (though common in porters and stouts these days), but i had several other blonde ales with coffee and sometimes the combination works well.  medium thick, opening and thin, snow white, loose head on an initially clear but later misty yellow blonde robe with apricot tinge.  aroma of indeed coffee in a sugared kind of way but certainly recognisable as such, white chocolate, breakfast cereals, ripe pear, cherry blossoms in spring, ripe melon, vanilla extract and a persisting scent uncannily similar to c c mel.  clean onset, sweet with a sourish but refreshing, mandarin-like side note, hints of pineapple and ripe pear, softishly carbonated; slick and thin, even rather watery mouthfeel.  sweet pale maltiness, notes of melon, pineapple and mandarin subtly continuing and accompanied with these odd c c mel and white chocolate elements, with the coffee powder providing some mildly astringent spiciness in the end as well as a bit of dryness - much needed, because hops remain very understated and the faint bitterness which is present, seems to be generated more by the coffee than by hops.  the lack of hops does not help the already thin and watery feel, but the overall flavours are admittedly fascinating, with the coffee behaving less spicy and bitter than expected - instead, this whole beer feels like a light, sweet, mellow, summery quencher with odd but pleasant aromatic effects.  quite distinct and enjoyable for what it intends to be."

Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,can from holiday market. pours a mostly clear gold with a finger of white foam that lingers. light roasted coffee aromas with faint cream soda notes as it warms. dry cream soda on the palate with some pilsner malt notes. lingering coffee and light bitterness. not sweet at all with a relatively dry finish. pretty fun beer.

Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,pint glass pour at stanley's in ne mpls. deceptively blond in color despite the light coffee roast aroma. picking up some butter cream frosting elements too which i'm not complaining about. taste carries roasty notes offset by a heavy dose of grains. actually feels like it pulls back on the coffee throttle which is a little disappointing. lingering cream soda element. not one of my favorites.
Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,"pours a hazy blonde colour. smells of vanilla apple pie, no real coffee. taste is of a weak blonde fading into a nice vanilla coffee mix. lovely finish ruined by a watery, weak body. makes me 'rethink' my perception of light and dark beers indeed, in the sense that my preconceptions are reinforced. good for a taste, but not to look for again."
Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,"yes, there is surely coffee and vanilla in this one, but the blond ale is somewhat watery and that is what you get when the vanilla is worn off. combines better with a stronger ale i reckon."

Odd Side Ales Bean Flicker: Coffee Blonde,3.5,"poured from a bottle. 
aroma is fairly sweet with a cream-like aroma with some light grain notes. an off vegetable note which i assume is the coffee. some light vanilla. 
pours a somewhat clear, gold with a small, moderately thick, white head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges where a thin film lingers. moderate lacing and small legs. 
flavor is sweet, but less than i was expecting from the aroma. some light grain notes. moderate creamer-like sweet notes with some vanilla present. the weird vegetable note from the aroma isn t here, but there also isn t really any coffee. as it warms some light coffee appears, but it really tastes like beer with some vanilla flavored creamer. medium light bitterness. 
mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. light astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
overall, another not great beer from this brewery. it s really weird as the coffee character is rather faint, but the other flavors and aromas are very pronounced."

trying to be objective with this beer, though it's difficult. it was a long time ago that i had the regular urbock and while this is no 4.5 that i gave that, there's still a lot to love here. rich, sumptuous, decadent malts, balanced, yet intense smoke and a reasonable acidity to balance it, alongside pretty good attenuation. i think 8 years is pushing it here and would love to see this closer to about 4. but the fact that it's still in spectacular shape after 8 years speaks volumes and it's hard not to gush and fall in love with it again."

Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock Jahrgangsbier 20xx,3.8,"500ml bottle - thanks philip for 3d printing these for us! 2016 vintage (8:4:7:3:14=3.6)
deep brown, somewhat fizzy head. lovely rich sweet smoky aroma while pouring - classic schlenkerla. milder and mellower in the glass, drier, tarrier, kipper oils. surprisingly light palate, carbonation a little high. pleasant malty body, dry smoky bitterness, again more hints of kipper oils. dry finish, bitter, has a little acidic bite, that's probably the carbonation. not as full and mellow as a fresh normal urbock, but that is a mind-blowingly good brew. very solid strong rauch, but no cigar."

medium, oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. finishes smokey, roasty, wooden, toasty, slightly sweet, with dark chocolate, some toffee, some dark bread.

very tasty! the nose is quite similar to the regular urbock. the taste, while still very smokey and wooden, has a lovely, creamy chocolate character, almost like a barley wine. therefore it drinks quite heavy for the abv, which fits though. score: 8 / 4 / 9 / 4 / 17"

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bloody lovely . really really enjoyed this . one of nicest tripels i ve had as some can be just too much for me . usually go for dubbels / quads as prefer darker style. lovely candied fruit . not heavy , not boozy or burning . fantastic . just up my street."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,super crisp. golden. strong. really nice when one is in the mood for a quality strong beer in the established yet groundbreaking belgium brewing tradition. this is a country which seriously knows what it's doing with it's well defined brewing genre.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"smells belgian, but very thin. strongly carbonated, quite light for a triple. is a bit sweet with a slight bitterness. leaves some kind of juniper-style aftertaste at the end, slightly sweet. this beer tastes specific, especially because of this finish. does not thrill me."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,golden with a white head - malt and some yeast in the aroma - malt body with some floral and yeasty hints - malt and some yeasty flavours in the finish - this was good
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle from lcb. pours a clear gold with lively white foam but settles nicely. aroma of wheat, banana, some citrus peel and spice. taste of sweet malts, banana, flora, candied fruits, some spice. mid to full bodied, soft semi-frothy carbonation which works well. quite a floral bitter in the finish. 

nice although i was expecting there to be more accentuation of flavour considering how highly rated this is."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"on tap at the bavarian lodge in lisle, il. for their weihenstephaner & st. bernardus braupakt 2024 release party as a near 14 oz. serving to a logoed tulip, showing a hazed, straw color, with a sudsy layer of white froth, and ribbons & spots of lacing. the nose was modest malt, light citrus & dried fruit, and subtle floral & spice hints. a little less than medium bodied, the taste was similar but a bit less expressive, with good carbonation, well incorporated alcohol, and pleasant dryness to the finish. didn't notice much in the way of typically subtle banana & clovey phenols, but a decently flavorful tripel, nonetheless."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"tap at lambiczoon, milan, with vincent, 26th march 24.  pours straw yellow.  aroma is sweet, yeast, floral.  taste is floral, yeast, caramel, sweet, honey, quite hoppy and fresh.  nice"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"my expectations of a tripel are to have a fruity, floral taste, with a bit of a sweet finish. this tripel has a very dominant sour taste. i don't enjoy that in a tripel."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"the smell is grainy, pleasant with light sweet fruity notes. the color is light, closer to light brass. the taste is balanced. at first, it is pleasant grainy, then sweetly bitter, with hop notes."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"3 finger white head, yellow body. nose: yeast, lemon, banana, honey, candy-sugar, wheat, spicy notes and white pepper. taste: white bread, lemon, yeast, oranges, funk, white pepper, spicy notes, banana, honey, candy-sugar and wheat. semi-long ending with some bitterness."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"another brew i assumed unrated needed to tick. orange pour and small head. nose is light yeast and fruits. tastes of orange, bready, candy, banana, clove. straight forward palate. not as sweet  and boozy as a lot of triples."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"jack of all trades. so versatile as to go with almost anything: pizza, pasta, mussels, bbq. gorgeous on its own slightly chilled. 
absolutely gorgeous head, the most pristine white foam gathers on top and sticks around for quite a while. semi-hazy, golden yellow, straw yellow in color.
fantastically sweet on the nose: juicy, fruity and floral. i get papaya, strawberries, raspberries and a bit of rose.
fresh, fruity and crisp in the mouth. brings to mind the mango ipa fad a couple years back: flavors of apple juice, exotic fruits. medium-bodied, mouthfeel is gentle yet envigorating. delightful bitterness, the hops are mixed in perfectly to keep everything balanced and fresh, prevents the sweetness from overpowering. truly one of the best tripels i ve ever had. the intense fruity sweetness keeps it from getting a perfect score, as it can be a tad overwhelming. but all in all an excellent beer, pairs wonderfully with any creamy, meaty or tomatoe-based dish."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"tasted in a tulip, orange-gold colour, cloudy, white foam with good retention. when bringing the nose close to the glass, aromatic notes of belgian yeast, bread, cereal, freshly baked cake, banana, spices (white pepper, cloves) are perceived. in the mouth it enters impregnating the palate with floral tones and sweet notes of ripe fruit (apricot, orange, kumquat...), immediately balanced with an aftertaste of bitter hop character and spices, a harmony that flows in all directions of the palate and does not stop...delicious."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"l likes Belgian l. s d, light and if you can call a l for bld, then it is very covering.

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pale-golden, frothy white head, and hazy. candy, floral, apple, and fruity aroma. apple, mild sour, fruity mild lemon flavors. mild  alcohol and fruity-apple-sour dominate."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"The St. Bernadus Tripel has already received a lot of advance praise - I hope it is justified. The smell of yeast and peach is not particularly special, I prefer the yellow, opal color. The head is lush and sufficiently stable in its fine pores. The first sip is yeasty, dry and very effervescent. The high carbonation is unusual for this style of beer, but I like it very much. Perhaps also because the usual malt aromas are missing and the whole composition is designed to be sweet. The finish leaves a bitter impression, but this comes from the carbonation and the 8% alcohol and not from the strong hops, which have no aroma here. Outstanding and unusual compared to other triple beers, but the bottle should have a warning label, as the glass is quickly empty and the liver complains.

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"The St. Bernardus Tripel, old gold with a powerful, fine-pored head, flows from the brown 0.33l bottle with a laughing monk on the label into the glass. It smells fruity and sweet. The first sip tastes tangy and fruity. Full-bodied. In the middle part it is fruity with a slight acidic note. Malty and yeasty. The last third is mildly hoppy with a subtle peppery spiciness. It is an extraordinary beer that you should try."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"golden, slightly hazy appearance. poured with a small head, initial thought was that its very sweet and full bodied. a classic example of this style which left no lacing. very drinkable, even if it is a bit sweet for my taste."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"first time I taste this beer and I am pleasantly surprised.
abundant white foam topped with truly pleasant and complicated aromas and scents. in the mouth you immediately feel the Belgian yeasts and the alcoholic warmth is not at all invasive"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"excellent foam. nose. malt, light caramel, fruits, floral and herbal notes. taste. hints of fruit (pear, apple) yeast, malt, slightly spice aftertaste and light hops. well, it's perfectly brewed, but the taste in this beer sags."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"dense smoke inside bottle  then almost completely silent pour into a trappist glass. rich cloud like soup of whiteish head. cloudy golden color beneath. soapy lacing. wafts of sweet fruity aroma, even from arms length distance from glass. striking malt sugary fruit scents halted in first taste by a hop bite. extraordinary taste found after each additional pour. elite league of a brew. the head remains similar to the creamy foam on a latte, and stays with duration of drink. too bad one doesn t live in belgium. the snappy yeats taste is crafted for the tongue like a toasty wool sock for the foot in winter. balance of sweet flavors, only minimally bitter. finish is mild and pleasing."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"you can feel it coming in, strong taste, unfortunately a tripel with the necessary sharpness"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"33 cl bottle from systembolaget. the aroma is a bit ""spicy"" with peppery notes. it's also quite sweet with notes of honey and vanilla. the flavor is sweet and savory but still has a good amount of bitterness/""spiciness"" to it. long aftertaste. not bad."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle from belgium via mattias. a wit leaning tripel aroma. bright yellow colour. a tasty tripel bringing in usual flavours, with a high carbonation finish and a slightly too strong boozy bitterness. it mellowed the more i drank it and was a pleasure to drink. they are right about the sweet and sour - tasting both fresh and mature."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"330ml bottle from we brought beer, tooting.  bizarrely not rated this before.  pours a lightly hazy mid golden.  aroma is actually quite hoppy; spruce, dill, peppercorns and pale malt on the nose.  flavour has an upfront bite of bitterness, before turning into complex sweetness, nice honey and dried fruit flavours.  i think this is my favourite of the sb beers."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"This is a golden colored beer, with a hint of salt, and a very present g. Interesting bitterness, a beer to be repeated."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pours light golden cloudy.

well saturated.
tastes still like weizen on steroids, no esters, banana cloves, a bit dull.
not unpalatable, but overall very thin."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"banana, cloves, bread... is it a tripel or a belgian witbier?! pretty good, but unexpected."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"330ml bottle from trembling madness. clear golden with a big white head. aroma is bread and banana, flavour is similar with stone fruit, clove, coriander. doesn't taste its strength"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"Stranger aromas than the expected strength and liquor theme with an alcohol content of 8%. Instead, more floral and fruity nuances, with some malt. Opaque, medium yellow colour, intense, honey-like. A thin layer of foam on top, more uniform than dispersed.
It does not disappoint in the mouth, showing everything that it seemed to in the nose, soft and delicate despite being a triple abbey beer.
Very, very rich, and very mythical."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"Good beer, nothing special but well made. Despite having a high alcohol content, you can't notice it. It goes down easily. Foamy."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"a lightly hazy dark golden, hazier on second pour. quite big white head (actually not that much for a tripel), dense, with good enough persistence and lacing. nicely complex and vivid aroma. fruity notes (peach most prominent) upfront, with a lot of underlying notes: a white bread/dough base, slight sugar, honey, chamomille, hints of earthiness and spiciness. taste notes follow the aroma, though maybe with a bit less brightness/definition. medium to high sweetness, quite low bitterness, but still in good enough balance. a bit of warming feel, but perfectly hidden alcohol. medium body, medium to high carbonation (small-bubbled carbonation), resulting in a lively mouthfeel. overall, a well made tripel that went down super easily for the style, but somehow didn't leave that much of an impression."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"33 cl bottle from labirratorium, served in a leffe chalice.

it pours a hazy dark golden with an ephemerous off-white head. you love my english, and you know it.

aroma is bread, cardamom, coriander, yeast, lemon, some unidentified balm, and... white chocolate. yep.

slick, dry and medium carbonated to start with. midpalate it gets oily, balanced and it displays a lovely acidity. nice metal touches leading to a long-lasting, bitter finish. boy, is this a good tripel."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"330 ml bottle. cloudy golden with a bit white head. nose is clove and banana sweetness. tastes of banana, spicy clove, sharp alcohol, light sweetness. lingering booze. surprisingly alcoholic in flavor. clove spiciness lasts into the aftertaste. soft carbonation and medium bodied. not my favorite, but at least it isn't overly sweet."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,this is a nice triple but not my favourite. well carbonated and light mouthfeel. spicy flavours.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"golden pour with a lively head and good retention. aroma; yeast and barley (bread dough notes) taste; clean and crisp. a perfect balance of sour notes from the yeast and rounds out to sweet barley and caramel notes. top notch!

cracking beer, strong and flavourful. really good!"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"smells medium intensity: peach, candy, banana and spices. relatively sweet in taste. banana in the foreground, a bit of clove, slight bitterness, lacking."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pours a light white bread crust with orange accents with an eggshell head that lingers.  aroma is bananas, rye and a spicy strong yeast. perhaps some lemon zest.   carbonation is immediately lively and more than i expected.  despite the carbonation, there s almost a creaminess that hits first followed by a mellow bitter.  there s certainly bread, but then it s as if it was steeped rather briefly with light fruits, maybe even dried light fruits but not at all sweet.  flour.  subtle but not watery.   it s very very balanced and very restrained.  the carbonation sticks around and keeps the creamy consistency going with each sip.   maybe i was expecting more pronounced flavors.  it s exceedingly well crafted, and i may be me that s the blunt force object."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"0.33 l bottle in front of goblet beer store, zagreb. aroma is yeasty, spicy, lemony, coriander, grainy malts, pear and some banana. medium to full body, soft carbonation, creamy texture. fruity flavour, peach, banana, cloves, biscuit. light but lasting, dry and spicy finish."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"aroma of maltiness, yeast and herbaceous. bitter taste of maltiness, yeast and herbs. okay bitter that fills the upper part of the mouth for a long time. the beer needed a little heat to get better. okay beer. follow me @ kung av  l @ facebook for more pictures and ratings."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,a triple almost suitable for regular consumption because it is rather well balanced.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"typical golden tripple colour. smells slightly sweet and yeasty. taste is belgium yeast heavy, earthy floral hops and light citrus fruits. solid beer"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"much lighter than i expected - really lovely! a present from suzie, very much enjoyed this!"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"Belgian triple classic. spicy touch, fruity point (pl tan), yeast, maltose and dol a. good!"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"330 ml bottle from a local supermarket. pours a slightly opaque amber with a huge white head. aroma of mostly malt and a little bit of fruity esters. tastes of malt, temperate fruits, slight alcohol, slight bitter. quite flowery and perhaps slightly spicy as well. dry finish. slight oily mouthfeel and decently strong carbonation."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle from the packie, surprised i haven't rated this. 
lightly hazy light gold in color with a huge frothy white head that slowly recedes. sweet honey like maltiness with earthy floral hops light citrus fruit earthy funk and light alcohol."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,blonde - fairly soft tasting beer! quite pleasant with a fruity and soft aftertaste
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"tasting package with 4 bernardus-beers, including dedicated glass. slightly hazy golden pour with white head, falling down quickly and nearly completely. aroma is yeasty, fruity (bit banana?); later weaker. taste a mix of citric, yeasty, soft bitter and mild sweet. very strong carbonation (although not supporting the head, nor the aroma). this tripel is divergent from its belgian brothers & sisters, but less convincing."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottled. very lively, like champagne. big off white head. the aroma has yeast. the taste has champagne, oak, cork. nice finish."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle with drink by date of 2/3/22 (consumed 11/27/20): nose has very slight sweetness with a belgian/grass dankness; light yellow hue and white lacey head; light mouthfeel with effervescent carbonation; taste belgian yeast forward with lemon, spice & grass notes that transends to a nice dry finish with a bit of lingering bitterness."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"0.33 bottles. Opal golden yellow color, loose white foam, appears to be acidic. the smell is more spicy, but champagne, spicy, intense v. Champagne without sour drink. f times, cognac alcohol, full-bodied, candied sugar.  serious drink, but I've had a better triple. a little cognac foam remained in the end, thanks to the strong carbonic acid. as it warms up, airs out, it becomes finer, you can feel it more, and even more complex.
***
opaque golden yellow color, loose white foam, looks quite carbonated. it smells like a spicier, sweet champagne, spicy, intense. sizzling champagne. spicy, cognac alcoholic, full-bodied, candy sugar. serious drink, but i've already drunk a better triple. a thin foam remained throughout, thanks to strong strong acid. as it warms up, ventilates, it is more delicate, more flavors can be felt, even hops."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"light amber color, white foam and floral scent. citrus and thirst-quenching flavor."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"in glass this amazing beer has a misty golden hue with a arctic white froth, it drinks with a beautiful soft creamy texture, a rich typically yeasty flavour, spicy and rewarding it doesn t disappoint."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pours light hazy golden with a lasting thin white head. aroma of pine, green banana and hay. medium body with spices, bitterness. good but nothing special, i expected more of this one."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"golden beer, white head. bready, lightly zesty aroma. flavour has some zestiness too, a little boozy warmth, slightly floral. good strong flavour and doesn't have the sickliness that comes with the lesser examples of the style in the finish. lovely stuff."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"in the aroma belgium, spices, wheat. overall a lot of freshness in the taste, alcohol relatively unnoticeable, classic, good tripel."

[ i t n  gar e, 3 , lahvov  pivo, koup@ v dsk m obchod ]"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"tripel as a tripel should be. it smells mildly flowery. the taste is balanced and not spoilt by a sugary sweetness, as in some more modern triples. there is some yeast, citrus and a higher then expected bitterness throughout."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"delicious beer. refreshing and light feeling despite great depth of flavour - nutmeg, citrus peel, yeast and hot cross buns with a spicy core and honeyed finish"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle. the nose is attracted by the fruitiness. the olfactory intensity is normal and the way it persists is sufficient. the upper beer coat is characterized by a foam with good retention. the size of the bubbles is medium-fine. the liquid has a clear consistency. medium-fine bubbles also constitute the form of the fizz. the color is deep golden yellow. the body is full. the bitterness is discreet. the gustatory strength is high and the permanence is good. the final mouthfeel sensations are of drinkable beer. the aftertaste is intense. the aroma in the mouth bears signs of honey, dried fruit and citrus."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"Fine-pored, large and long-lasting foam head of an orange cloudy triple. Strong smell of yeast, hops and a little of mirabelle plums. Very fresh, full-bodied first sip with herbal and citrus notes. Still very fresh, full-bodied body with dominant yeast and herbal notes. Long, slightly sour and slightly bitter, still very fresh aftertaste. Sparkling triple that shouldn't be drunk too cold and that hides its 8% dangerously well."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"Dark yellow color, medium cloudiness, translucent. White foam almost two fingers thick and medium retention. Medium intense aroma of cereal, dry hay, yeast, bread and farm, notes of nuts. Flavor along those lines, pure farm, long finish, malty and slightly alcoholic. Semi-oily texture. Medium-high carbonation.

A delight at a very good price."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"tastes okay. i can see myself drinking an entire bottle and feeling content. the look of it is perfect! great caramel look, and has a rich look it."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"kind of disappointed with this. i've had it many times before and i don't know if i've changed or it's changed or what but it wasn't just as good this time. not bad just not great. average head and dirty dishwater appearance. aromas of wet grain, toffee, and a little dark fruit. flavors can pick up the candy sugar sweet up front with a little bitter coming on okay body and finish."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pale and hazy with a frothy head.
smooth, piney, smell of straw. grainy taste at the attack, then a light syrupy sweetness sets in. a very satisfying body. piney aftertaste.
this is one of the best tripels i ever drank."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"solid tripel, mild bitterness and carbonation, a very round and mellow flavor profile. no acidity, but delightfully wheaty aftertaste that lingers."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"testing many beers with friends in Caesar's, no possibility of detailed description."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle (best before end 04 07 21) pour from total wine & more, burlington. appearance is hazy orange-gold with tons of sparkle, 2-finger foamy white head with fair retention and trace lacing. aroma is strong yeast with mix of sweet and sour fruit. taste is slightly dominant sweet fruit and floral over sour (as described), reminiscent of sparkling wine. mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth, frothy texture, pleasant alcohol warmth in the esophagus, average carbonation with lively ending and dry finish as taste with lingering mild bitterness. overall, a good representative of the style and things are balanced well but it's not terribly complex so somewhat boring and a bit overcarbonated."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle. clear yellow pour with a white head. biscuit aroma.  spice, malts (rye bread), prickly carbonation with hints of clove. average body and mouthfeel. not my favorite style but pretty on point for what it is."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle from belgiuminabox.
pours a murky golden/amber colour with a huge foamy white head. aromas of stoney fruits, apricots, grapes, apples, bananas, pears, bread and hints of bubblegum. taste is exactly how it smells with the same notes coming through in the mouth. light bodied with a nice fruity finish. nice beer yet again from that bald headed monk at st. bernardus!"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"i'm not really impressed about this ""tripel"". i mean is a good beer not doubt about that but is very strange for the style. in general i love ""tripel"" beers but this beer remind me more one ""weissbier"".. 
the beer has big notes of banana and it's very spicy like the whole series from this ""brewery"". has a lot carboration inside and that hit you more than usual in your mouth. on the other hand the finish is very good and the beer is slightly refreshing.. lastly the beer has slightly sour direction..
overall like a beer in general is good but i prefer other beers from this specific style."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"bottle - pours golden with a big head. strong aromas of malt and tart fruit. good mouthfeel, malt backbone with that ""triple"" taste"" with a warm alcohol finish. solid beer."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"thick head and a hazy, golden color. aromas of ripe yellow fruits, candy and some paraffin. the taste is quite similar to its smell, but has a bit of a sour undertone. bready, hint of bananas. nicely balanced. creamy, vanilla sweetness. subtly floral and herbal. mild bitterness. slightly dry finish, but a nice smooth aftertaste. still a bit thin, a bit light for a tripel. very accessible and tasteful though. nice."

St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"on tap at world of beer in bethesda, md. 

lightly hazy amber-gold with an off-white head and good lacing. 

aroma of wheat, apricot, bread, cloves and black pepper. 

taste of peach pie filling, apricot, butterscotch, wheat, cloves, black pepper and other light fruit. 

medium/full body and high/medium carbonation."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"amber to golden color, rising bubbles are plentiful, up to a relatively tall, creamy, bubbly head from a very careful pour. slightly hazy with suspended yeast. the head recedes moderately quickly, leaving some lacing just above and following the head down to a cap. nice sheets on the opposite side of the glass as you drink.

aroma is bready and fruity. ripe peaches and apricots. spicy - clove and black pepper. slightly funky. crackery and earthy.

taste is dry and fruity. earthy and spicy. the ripe to perhaps overripe fruit - peach and apricots - mellows out a very slight bitterness.  no hint of the abv - the alcohol is well hidden. the finish and aftertaste are very dry.  the bready, crackery malts compliment the spicy pepper and fruity esters, but with not even a hint of sweetness.

body is moderate with noticeable carbonation tingling.

well crafted beer. a joy to enjoy! ;-)."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"nice big bottle, cloudy light amber beer with heavy fine and long stable white head, smell is herbs, light fruity, taste is typical belgium beer, herbs, alcoholic, very light bitter, fizzy carbonation, full body, creamy texture, perfect,"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"When I got this beer yesterday in the lovely 0.75l sparkling wine bottle, I thought I hadn't had it for a long time, but it was actually new to me.
It's a lovely, classic triple, but it seems a bit more velvety and sweet (and sweeter) to me than most of its kind.
It may be an industrial product now, but it tastes really great."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"burnt sugar, citrus, pepper butterscotch. creamy, a bit sweet but very tasty. some umami somewhere in there"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pours hazy topaz with a thick and frothy ivory head. aroma yields fresh malt, yeasty, stone fruit and subtle resiny hop tones. flavor delivers zesty fresh malt, yeasty, stone fruit, butterscotch and resiny hops. texture provides lively fizz and smooth, fair body. this tripel is no tripe!"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,very tasty tripel. visited the brewery in watou belgium it s off the charts outstanding.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,triple beer with a golden color. strong effervescence and persistent foam. acidic beer with a slight bitterness in the middle of the mouth. strong taste at the beginning and fades quickly. refreshing beer that goes wonderfully well for a triple.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,yellow/golden. aroma is coriander slight grain some straw and hay and a bit of grapes. taste is sour malt with grainy sour body. some fruity nuances. quite fresh and a bit hoppy. drinkable. too much strange sourness for a very good one.
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"pours clear, pale dark golden with a full, white head.  aroma is dried fruit and caramel.  taste is light plum and caramel, moving to some tartness and belgian yeast.  finish is tartness and light plum.  a good tripel."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"03-09-19 // bottle .yeasty hazy golden. whitehead. belgian yeasty, some spices. quite light and so very well balanced. lovely."
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"high malt flavor with nice carbonated mouth feel. golden hazy beer. crisp, crackery flavor, and refreshing. does not drink like an 8% abv beer"
St. Bernardus Tripel,4.2,"330ml glass bottle for  5.25 from drink of fulham.  dated as best before 05/03/2020. served into an oversized wine glass after being left to warm out of refrigeration for around 30 minutes.

the appearance is fantastic. a perfect golden straw colour, very hazy with some visible sediment in the glass. a huge fluffy white head with bubbles of extreme variation in size. the head is very slow to settle to one finger. despite the haze multiple streams of micro bubbles that race towards the surface of the drink are visible.

the first hit of aroma is strong strong alcohol. disappointingly this is what dominates the rest of the inciting smells. coriander, lemon, fresh fruit, and yeast. a slight sour quality exists with just a feint hint of sweetness. think a watered down flanders red ale. 

it is the sour lemon that most prominent in the taste. imagine a baked lemon that hasn t been sweetened and has had all of the juices drained away to leave just flesh, taking away any sharpness or sweetness but leaving a sourness that does not quite cause your lips to pucker. coriander and yeast are also notable flavours. a beer that is more sour than sweet with a nice mild spice. 

on the palate the sour lemon and the coriander linger slightly but it is the mouthfeel that provides a point of difference to most tripels. dry but not to the brut. the alcohol that is not present in the taste hits the pit of the stomach to suggest a much higher percentage than the advertised eight. 

overall, a slightly different example of the style considering the sweetness in most tripels. a very good beer but just lacking compared to the better examples."

Lervig Rackhouse - Paragon 2022,4.3,".2 from tap, shared with snegurochka. deep reddish brown semi-transparent body with no head to speak of. served a bit cold so aroma is not that impressive to begin with, but it does grow on you once it heats up. the wonder of this extremely well-balanced brew really hits you when you taste it, perhaps best compared to biting down on a high-end chocolate confectionery. there is the obvious taste of chocolate, bitter notes of coffee and well integrated and heartwarming notes of alcohol. all this is quite normal for this type of beer if well made, but what puts it over the top is the citrusy - think dried orange - flavour and notes of clove that combines so well with the above-mentioned tastes. while a smorgasbord of confectionery pleasure, the brew thankfully avoids the over-sweet or artificial impressions that sometimes accompany such flavours. when the aftertaste with strong notes of vanilla lingers as long as it does in a perfectly pleasurable way, there is not much to complain about. a more or less perfect dessert in itself, lervig upholds their lofty standards with this wonderful sipping experience."

Tired Hands Ourison,3.5,"cheers eugene (beastiefan2k) for the us pint can of this. drank at my daughters place in laguna hills on 5th july 2024. misted light lemon/grapefruit colour, no head. tart citrus nature, lemon and limes to the fore, grapefruit too. it's what i call a 'dirty farmyard' saison because of it's funky/brett like feel."
Tired Hands Ourison,3.5,"from a 16fl oz can with bb of 3/6/24 so a bit overdone. pours clear pale golden with a minimal transient white head. woody chardonnay notes, light funk, lemony citrus and bready malts on the nose. taste follows, tart, dryish finish, vinous mouthfeel, low carbonation. a pleasant saison with more wine-like characteristics than most saisons."
Tired Hands Ourison,3.5,"pours a clear, pale golden coloration with a small, fluffy head and slightly visible carbonation. smells of doughy malt and grassy, citrus hops, with hints of hay and esters also coming through. taste is a good balance of doughy malt and fruity, grassy, slightly floral hops, with notes of grapefruit, lime peel orange blossom and hay as well as lighter fruity and spicy esters, with notes of apricot, gooseberry and clove and just a hint of oak and very subtle funkiness coming through as well. finishes with a medium tartness and some lime peel, gooseberry and clove lingering in the aftertaste. effervescent mouthfeel with a light/medium body and medium/strong carbonation.

this is quite a typical ""american saison"" to me, in fact it's so hoppy that i would almost call it an ""india pale saison"". personally i prefer a saison to have more of an estery than hoppy flavor profile, but this certainly makes for a rather enjoyable brew in its own way, even though the hops clearly outmuscle the esters with strong grassy, floral, citrus notes here. it's quite zesty actually, with a distinct, lemony tartness, but much lighter estery fruit and spice, oak and funky accents. very nice, effervescent mouthfeel though, which adds to the refreshing character here. certainly a great brew to have on a hot summer day."

evocative elderflowers and starfruit lead to prolonged citrusy acidity in this dry, effervescent and rustic masterpiece.



further personal perceptions:

-a veil of foam covers the pale straw blond.

-the bottle conditioning job is very nice. ample and supple carbonation.

-drinkability is sky high.

-the finish is very memorable.

-this is not unlike some of hill farmstead s best efforts in the style category.

Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"from the brewmaster at the brewery in kelheim. what a pleasant surprise .... a sour from a mix of aventinus and eisbock. bottle 750ml tap x 2019 limited edition, 9.5% alcohol by vol. pours mahogany with good head. immediate aroma of bretty sourness and plenty of dark fruit. balanced sourness with rich mouthfeel. brewmaster told me this only spent 8 months in oak, i'm expecting some of the brett flavors arose in bottle. this is really a special treat."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"2013 bottle opened in 2022. clear dark copper colour with thin head. aroma has a fruity, sour note akin to a cascade or a very strong vlaams rood. flavour is tangy and sour but not harsh. it has done well over the years."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,draft at bru craft during the 2022 sour bowl. 2018 version. cloudy brown with just a slim ring of white foam. the barrel aging works well. slightly tart - not aggressively so. the darker malts have mellowed. glassy sugar caramels. hints of dark red fruit. sour cherry. prune. vanilla. strange - feeling the base aventinus underneath but it has been amazingly transformed!
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"keg at lhg brewpub, bristol.  deep ruby and lightly hazed.  huge nose, similar to a flemish red.  loads of redcurrant, prunes, tart berries and tannins.  this is immensely complex and so, so tasty."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"375ml bottle brewed in germany at 9.5%. 2018 edition. cloudy ruddy-muddy with a decent-sized head that loudly fizzed away in half a minute, leaving a very small spot of foam being steadily, audibly replaced by rising bubbles. tart vinous grape skins and just a little fruity pear up front in the aroma, hiding a deeper darker bouquet, perhaps some fig, but also liquorice, a whisper of tobacco, and even something akin to turkish delight. lowish carbonation, but a good refreshing tartness to the solid body. though the sour cherry-like tartness from the wine barrel is most obvious, aventinus makes its presence here known, and so on the palate unfolds some of that dark dry clove and some of those mouthwatering meaty notes, along with light tobacco and juicy dry black grape. pay more attention and a little banana and pear subtlety is revealed. the aftertaste has a soupcon of chocolate malt and a whiff of barrel vanilla, with even a touch of wheat rusk for the observant. good stuff, and shows that beer aged in wine barrels need not be a gimmick - although this is undoubtedly a beer aged in wine barrels, with considerable if not predominant wine character; perhaps it shows aventinus was a good choice for the treatment. this might just be one for the adventurous wine-drinker as much as, if not more than, the craft beer aficionado. most importantly, it's really quite tasty."

Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"beer from the 2016 edition drunk in January 2021. nice color, unique, on the border of light brown and very dark red, mild smell, rather reminiscent of wine, slightly spicy, spices (as if wild) and dried fruit. complex taste, with slightly noticeable alcohol, above all strongly acidic, dry, winey with a slight bitterness, it seems to me similar to some Rodenbach.
thick, a bit syrupy, caramel accents also appear.
""wine"", ""acidity"", bitterness, ""syrup"" and the result somewhere in the middle.
good - and whether very good depends on individual preferences. somehow I was not impressed but I do not intend to depreciate it, if very cold, at a milder temperature the taste would probably be slightly different."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"9.5% abv weizen bock, matured in wine barrels.
My copy was a few years old.
Auburn color with brown highlights, clear clarity.
Fine bubbles, in a central fountain, very lively.
Beige foam, fine flakes, as a surface coating.
Aromas of very ripe apples, apple compote, maple syrup.
1st mouth supple, the caramelized start with apple and pear.
Long aftertaste, very aesthetic.
2nd mouth with additional peach.
Long aftertaste, very soft.
Length that happily adds candied figs to this already complex ensemble, and which becomes very frankly so (like the franches

montagnes of the project's guide)
Smooth, long legs.
Very fine yeast, a little vinous, beautiful line.
alcohol very good, it is careful on the length
final supple and very pleasant
conclusion: the problem with these bis versions of the tap x is that they are
rare, even ephemeral, and not always very different from the original ..
despite a vinous research in this case."

Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"750ml bottle at a tasting in ruse. pours cloudy with a thick frothy head, lacing but no visible bead. aroma of sour cherry, toast and red wine. in the mouth, sourness right from the first sip, but an unexpected mixture of fruit and roasted malt flavours. some sugar and a slight bitterness that is masked by the intrinsic sourness. overall, a uniquely wine-like beer that has to be tasted to be believed or understood."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"version 2016. very winey in aroma, plus savages, grown in the best conditions. maybe it's already the twentieth bottle in my life, but again I was totally absorbed. dry, slightly sour. went in the direction of flanders, but without vinegar and characteristic sweetness. and this difference is not in the direction of lambics or white wines. barrel in a completely different dimension, than in sweet ris-s. and these wild stenches, simply awesome. I would like to rot as elegantly as this beer someday. what a beautiful thing."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"bottle (2014 edition). head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly/fully diminishing. body is cloudy dark brown. aroma is moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain), lightly yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket), with notes of cherry, oak, alcohol, band-aid, raisin. flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly bitter. finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.

this is not a weizenbock, empirically, even though the base beers are indeed a weizenbock and an eisbock. this is full-on sour and most closely resembles a strong belgian sour red / oud bruin. not bad when compared to things in the sour sphere...the nose is certainly pleasant if not super complex. boozy and watery/flabby, so not that much fun to drink, but all in all a fair beer. just don't rate it to style as a weizenbock."

Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"2014 bottle. first time i ve seen--much less tried--a chardonnay barrel-aged sour weizenbock, and damned if it isn t a pretty delicious beer. aroma s tart as hell, a strong yeasty sourness laced with oak, funk, and underlying sweet clove. the pour is just okay, coming out a hazy brown with red edges, but barely issuing up a head or lace. taste starts with a rainier cherry sweetness, tart and acidic on top of a sugary base, then quickly develops berry and citric notes, bright and assertive. the chardonnay barrels take hold on the back end, vanilla and oak and white wine all meshing with the dark fig and rum-banana weizenbock backbone of the beer. finishes vinous and with a lingering woodsy bitterness. scary how easy and drinkable the pint is, without a trace of alcohol warmth despite the 9.5% abv. shocked by the quality of this beer. this is something special."

looks: clear burgundy colour with a ring of stubborn dirt-like yeast sediments; less than one-quarter finger head with soapy off-white foam which fades in 20 seconds; fair sticky lacing and very slight carbonation.



aroma: very fragment malt, with strong red wine, port wine, strong red grape skins, grape juice, strong cherries, alcohol, pears, wood barrel, sugar, light lemon and light grass. lovely!



taste: mid to light sweet fair malt, with light pineapples, strong red wine, strong cherries, sour grapes, strong alcohol, strong liquorices, vanilla, wood barrel, molasses, light biscuits, yeast, lemon and medium bitter grassy hops. red wine delight!



body: medium body. very slick palate.



mouth feel: fair maltyness in a solid and quite thick background. any wheat and barley there were totally submerged into strong wine barrel, with loads of cherries, raw grapes and even some pineapple esters. fine smooth red wine flows though with strong oak undertone. fair sweetness, a bit dryish with sharp lemon to round. excellent!



booziness: with cellar aging, the 9.5% + abv is straight-up red winey and liquorish, which gets stronger with further sips but very comfy and not outlandish. very good!



hoppiness: light lemon and light grass in nose, same in taste but stronger; bitterness - mostly liquorices - fairly strong for a lasting, medium astringent cherry light malt finish.



after taste: fairly dry. very winey and fairly bitter to mouth.



comments: i suspect when this came out fresh a few years ago it may still be strong with the wheaty bock elements. thanks to aging, this is a fine amalgamation of wheat bock and wine barrels, totally integrated as a fine wine with nice fruityness and i keep asking for more. perfect!"
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"very interesting drink this weizen bock raised in a keg! knowing perfectly the classic aventinus, I can't wait to discover this product. transparent brown pour with beautiful reflections of dark topaz and microscopic foam. the nose is clearly that of a beer raised in a keg with this characteristic acidic note that we find on a sour beer or a lambic. we also perceive very persistent notes of grape, morello cherry, strawberry, redcurrant, blackcurrant... the mouth is a violent electric discharge: I have never drunk such an acidic beer. the texture is rather round, nothing to complain about, the alcohol totally undetectable despite an honorable 9.5%, the carbonation is correct, but what can we say about this sourness? we find the grape, the green apple side specific to cider, the bitter morello cherry, but the aftertaste is metallic and the wood side too intense. I am sorry to say it, and obviously this beer has fans, but I have the impression of drinking a bad sparkling wine mixed with vinegar. I really like beers like this (Rodenbach Grand Cru, Queue de Charrue Vieille Brune, Bourgogne des Flandes, etc.) but here, I say it loud and clear: it is clearly disgusting. So either my bottle has a serious problem (expiration date set in May 2019, there is room for improvement!), with a nice degassing when opened, or it is just not good to begin with. I have a hard time understanding the enthusiasm that such a beverage can trigger. Sorry for the venerable Schneider brewery, but I will be polite and say that I do not like it at all. the 50cl I have left can be used for a salad dressing... 75cl bottle, world drinks, saint-egr ve."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"great aroma of red wine, vanilla and oak. notes of kolak in the end (a bit of bread or caramel), but in this case it's an advantage. alcohol is present, but it doesn't attack. 


appearance: dark red color, hazy in the light. foam ecru color, finely bubbled, moderate. 


taste: distinct sourness, notes of wine, vanilla, wood, but also kolak - this time more - distinct in the form of bread, caramel and a bit of banana. alcohol is also noticeable, but again delicately. for me a great combination. symbolic bitterness, like in weizenbocks. fullness of the circle, moderate carbonation and sour, barrel finish. for me a bomb. I didn't expect that you could squeeze so much from kolak."
Schneider Weisse Tap X Mein Cuvée Barrique,3.5,"in the aroma vanilla, wood, a little wine aroma, there are some heavy kola notes in the form of bread, dark fruits. in the taste complex, sour with vanilla-wooden aftertaste, clearly these fruits, tannins, slightly stringy. it is also slightly sweet, but not in a typical kola way, more due to vanilla. alcohol imperceptible. for such a strong beer it is very watery, for which a minus, there is not much left of kola - this is already a matter of taste, personally I would prefer a little less acid and more bock, it could be even more interesting."

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"12 fl oz can. pours a cloudy amber topped with a finger of off white froth which persists for a bit. aroma is tropical fruity and prominent guava but only  little citrus. taste is again fruity sweet with plenty of guava, a real fruit salad going on in there! ends with a light floral bitter. a little light on the body with average carbonation. great tasting ipa, can drink it for days."
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"12 oz bottle, pours cloudy orange.  medium body.  citrus and malt aroma, tropical fruit hops taste with lingering bitter finish."

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"on tap @ bent elbow - pours a lovely clouded orange-gold with a puffy 2 finger cap....big pungent aromas of citrus and passion fruit over a musty malt base....flavor is juicy with hop citrus and exotic fruits almost balanced with a sturdy malt spine and chewy torrified grains, light earthiness,... goes to a long wet increasingly bitter but rounded finish with a hop bite...one of the best juicy neipas out there this summer."
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"not much of a fruity flavor, up front hippiness though. brown color, from tap."
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"on tap at brothers beer bistro (ottawa, on). hazy amber body with an average, lasting, off-white foamy head. good hoppy aroma with piney and citrusy hints. its sharp hoppy taste carries piney, malty, and herbal notes. ends with a long, sharp bitter finish. good stuff."
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"from a can poured a clouded amber with 2cm of tan dense foam that retained very well and laced well. carbonation high, average and fine to medium. aroma subtly of citrus and fresh hops with hints of tropical fruits (passionfruit) and stone fruit. aroma is semi-sweet citrus (orange, grapefruit) and caramel malt with moderate to high bitterness (not a real hops 'bite', just a bitterness that is there); juicy. medium body. smooth and dry with a lingering finish."
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"very nice red copper color, clear, transparent, works well. abundant foam, medium-durable, thick. strong hop aroma and citrus. lemon, grapefruit and lime. a bit sweet in taste, intense bitterness, a bit resinous finish. refreshing, river, well-drinking, medium-saturated. good IPA, nothing special but still better than worse."

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"12 oz bottlle into a pint shaker. i'm not the biggest fan of ipas, especially this trend of trying to ""out-bitter"" one another with an ungodly amount of hops. but this is a great ipa because the bitterness isn't overwhelming, and is balanced by great fruity, juicy flavors. nice orange color, lovely fruity hop aroma. one of the better ipas out there for having a 2nd one imo. this is the kind of ipa that you give to someone who doesn't really dig ipas (like me). and it's pretty much the only ipa i buy and drink regularly. juicy!"

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"fruity, citrusy, very delicious. very mellow for a 60 ibu. not a big fan of ridiculously bitter beer, but this ipa with a fairly high ibu is as smooth as a classic lagunitas ipa. seriously, try this beer!"
Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"overall, a good beer. but this beer did not have my expected level of long lasting hop aroma for an ipa. color is amber brown with off-red under light; scent is not strong enough to me - sweet, pear scent, but was gone too fast; good taste, right on-par bitterness; finish was clean and after-taste is very pleasant. overall, i would recommend this beer. i would definitely try it if i can get a tap!!!"

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,not my first time having this beer which pushed the score a little higher giving it benefit of doubt. nice citrusy flavor with a good amount of grapefruit pith but also not nearly as bright and fresh tasting as i remember.

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"bottle pour from friar tuck, crestwood. appearance is clear, light brown/amber, with decent sparkle, finger-width beige, foamy head with light, leggy lacing. aroma is fruit--sort of a fermented fruit flavor--and a surprisingly strong malt presence. taste is vague fruitiness, lot of grainy malt. palate is light-to-medium bodied with thin, frothy texture, soft-to-average carbonation and dry, more sweet than bitter finish. overall, not a bad beer but sort of a misnomer. this has a strong malt presence, more like an apa, but was expecting tons of citrus/grapefruit. disappointing given the name."

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,the nose on this beer is outstanding- a fresh keg has a ton of citrus - grapefruit and lemon with a very smooth and fresh taste. the hops are present but not overpowering- and the finish is outstanding and smooth.

Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA,4.7,"freshly 3 month old six pack from lcbo, wow! pours a small foamy head and clear semi dark coat that promises and delivers some caramel tones. hop profile is west coast, and almost retro - lightly resiny and spicy with long notes of gently herbal bitter/spice that 'hang on' a little, followed by late dry bitterness. it's nice. the bready malt is lightly sweet but not annoying or sticky, all comprising a big bold ipa of circa 10 years ago and a style still very much welcome respite from the (also good) everything-is-hazy-northwest-ipa fad."

Fuller's Vintage Ale 2016,4.0,"bottle from waitrose. so i generally find these a bit disappointing, even with age, but this has a modern hop variety so curious to taste. pours clear orange to chestnut brown with almost no head. nose is the usual rich caraml, toffee, earthy hop, wet leaves, barley sugar, slight leather, but there s a new world hop in there which is adding lychee, bubblegum, herbal and berry fruits. on the taste there s quite a lot of tropical fruit mixing with berry fruit, caramel, toffee, barley sugar, ripe fruit, dried apricot. it s quite hard so it ll be interesting to see how this might soften with age. this is definitely the most interesting version of this i ve tasted. i suspect the fruit might die off just leaving the caramels, but i ve bought another to age so will return to this rating in the few years."

Schneider's Bayrisch Hell,3.4,"Visually light golden yellow and clear with medium-coarse perlage. The white, fine-pored head appears fluffy and has a moderately long shelf life. The aromas are very typical of the style, strong grainy to white bread-like malt and slightly grassy to hay-like hops. The first sip is fresh, tangy and grainy malt with a slightly hay-like hop note. The slightly sweet grainy malt notes and the slightly floral and hay-like, very gently bitter hop notes manifest themselves on the palate. A delicate buttery note also seems to resonate. Although this is not necessarily typical of the style, in my opinion it fits in very well. In the mouthfeel in particular, it goes perfectly with the gentle effervescence, the very delicate dryness and the soft, almost creamy, medium-strong body. This in turn also creates an incredibly good drinkability. In the aftertaste, the grainy malt notes linger very well and give way to a wonderfully grassy, ​​hempy and slightly floral hop aroma with a slight bitterness.
My conclusion: I don't know whether the ""butteriness"" that I mentioned comes from a delicate diacetyl note or is due to the creamy feel. The fact is that this beer is very good and the great hop aroma in the aftertaste is remarkable."

Schneider's Bayrisch Hell,3.4,"Now Schneider has also dared to jump on the trend called helles. The result is light gold and has a lush, creamy head in the glass. Mildly grainy and aromatic with floral accents and a fine graininess, the scent automatically makes you want to take a sip. This turns out to be distinctively barley, and the distinct sweetness known from many helles is pleasantly subtle in today's test candidate. The carbon dioxide content is very low, which of course benefits the sweetness. It remains simple and aromatic with gradually developing floral-fruity notes, even in the slim body. This successful helles ends with precisely these delicate hop aromas. Ultimately, Schneider's Helles Landbier is anything but spectacular, but really a very well-rounded, harmonious beer with a subtle hop aroma and a clear emphasis on barley malt."

Hearty grain, tart herbs, a hint of forest honey. Tastes (in a pleasant way) somehow slightly perfumed. Mild carbonation.

Schneider's Bayrisch Hell,3.4,"m nchener helles labelled as landbier - apparently i got the german version - from the hugely important and influential monument of bavarian brewing art that schneider is.  this beer has apparently been around since 1928, though i imagine its recipe having been finetuned over time, and comes from a 50 cl bottle in full-flegded german style, with the old schneider logo acting independently (not linked to the familiar words 'schneider weisse').  very thick and frothy, thickly lacing, pillowy, snow white head resting stable on a crystal clear, pure pale 'metallic' golden beer with disparate bubbles rising up throughout.  aroma of dry white bread, unripe conference pear, old crackers but not in a stale way, dried chamomile, deadnettle flowers, minerals, spring water, cold pasta, freshly cut grass, green weeds (sowthistle), flour, gum.  very 'clear' and clean taste, sourish effect from lively (yet not overly harsh) carbonation, lots of minerality underneath as if drinking spring water from a meandering mountain stream, rounded pale malt sweetishness with sharper grainy edges, a tad bready and cracker-like, in the end gently but importantly bittered by a noble, floral hop character evoking associations of field flowers, dandelion leaf and meadow grass, with also an unripe pear-like 'green' fruitiness to it - and even something very vaguely herbal (mugwort) in the end.  the hops provide a very mild, somewhat resinous and lingering bitterness, but only to top off that light-footed, grainy, sweetish pale maltiness and nothing more - the quintessence of a helles, and i think it is safe to say that this one belongs to the most archetypical of them all, even in the knowledge that it was actually spaten who invented the style thirty-four years earlier.  schneider craftmanship and bavarian authenticity in an easygoing, extremely solid and utterly well-balanced lager.  prosit!"

Schneider's Bayrisch Hell,3.4,"schneider's bayrisch hell pours a clear golden body and sports a white puffy head with nice lacing. a classic clean lager aroma with bready malts, cream, spicy and earthy noble hops, and a subdued citrus note greets the nose with a heavy emphasis on the malts. freshly baked white bread notes make up the bulk of the attack, followed by an elegant, subtle character of earthy noble hops that lingers well into the subduedly bitter finish with gentle heat. the body is full with a voluminous and starchy mouthfeel throughout and is accompanied by a medium-low carbonation with a conscious eschewal of flashiness. while not unique, every aspect of this brew represents what a helles is supposed to be. when schneider ventured out to the world of lagers, it sure had done its homework to understand what makes the style great."

lightly hazy brown (chestnut-mahogany) body shows scant carbonation and a small beige head that recedes quickly to a ring.
haven t had this one in a while, the last being a zymatore version of 2014, i believe and probably a 2011 or 2012 before that....i really loved those versions, though i found this one a bit barleywine-like. granted, that s more or less what it is, but it reminded more of an oxidized, malt-dominated, candyish english barleywine than a graceful, complex belgian strong ale. plentiful barrel character in the nose is enjoyable, but a big dose of caramel is there as well, dragging down the livliness/brightness. vanilla, raisins and other port-like qualities abound, with a light note of alcohol.
candy coated raisins, caramel and vanilla, prunes and moderate acidity make up the flavor. very low carbonation with a loose, watery mouthfeel and yet sticky, borderline syrupy malt texture. rather grapey, acetic-like sourness/tartness where i d want brett or lactic notes instead. fruity, moderately enjoyable, but certainly not my favorite release year."

2015-02-27, draught at pibar, lausanne, 8-4-7-3-16=38
hazy amber color with copper hue, small head. it has the classic, excellent aroma of the abbaye de saint bon-chien, vinous, oaky, sour. good body strength; it still has enough left sugar; malty, fruity, sour, this is excellent; it has a bit too much acetone though, hence the final is aggressive.
very good."

BFM Abbaye de Saint Bon-Chien (2013),4.2,"au f t @ ml fontainas (05/30/2014). sour wine beer, quite exceptional in its genre and rather unclassifiable.

amber beer offering a beautiful crimson color with a beautiful persistent very syrupy neck. its nose, extremely acidic stinging the nostrils is both ample and complex so much there is to drink and eat in this one: vinous, woody, fruit with hints of maraschino, acidic sugar, a floral hint of hops. the mouth is very heavy because of the alcohol + sugar mixture, offering spirits of brandy, initially acidic, then vinous (red grape), but which fades quite quickly. in the aftertaste, I note a distant return of malt on indeterminate notes and some bitterness. Too bad, this acidity which attacks the palate and the tongue all the time of the tasting and scrapes the throat for a strange length leaving a syrupy fruity acidity in the throat. (fruit vinegar, wine vinegar?) certainly less tasty than a Saint-Lambert. Too heady for my taste."

appearance: brown, opaque. brown, medium-low foam, fine-bubbled, compact, after a while it falls to a small last layer, leaves medium lacing. after stirring with a glass, a noticeable jelly texture.
aroma: good quality coffee. at a medium-high level, coffee, dark chocolate and dry coffee-purple fruits: blackberry, blueberry, bilberry, a bit of dried plum. the whole is supported by a medium-low salt base, dark bread, toasted bread crust, dark pastry base, roasted sunflower seeds, walnuts. oat notes looming in the background.
taste: similar to the aroma, good quality dry coffee dominates, but with a less intense soda base. at a medium-high level, coffee with dark chocolate, purple berries in the form of blackberries, blueberries, cranberries and a hint of dried plum. in the background, a low soda base, dark bread, toasted bread crust, dark pastry base, walnuts and roasted sunflower seeds. in the background, subtle notes of noble alcohol. in the mouth, persistent, low and smooth body, low carbonation. low bitterness, dark chocolate, roasted, short. dry finish, coffee, dark chocolate, an accent of purple dry fruits and a nuance of alcohol. 

generally: a very pleasant coffee with a persistent character with notes of dark chocolate, blackberries, blueberries and delicate dried plum. lacks a bit of a salty base, although thanks to that the coffee notes come out nicely. practically imperceptible oats, which makes the beer closer to fes than to the imperial oat version. despite this very pleasant."

Fremont Dark Star,3.6,"recently was able to visit the brewery on ski tri to visit one of my friends. brewery was nice and very crowded, was not able to get to try this there. glad i am now courtesy of tavour. good stuff. best part might be the many seconds of lingering flavor after the sip."
Fremont Dark Star,3.6,"on tap at brouwer's cafe, seattle. great smooth roasty aroma. so thick and roasty and sweet and bitter. like a bitter coffee chocolate milkshake."
Fremont Dark Star,3.6,"pours medium dark brown with a mocha head that builds from the bottom.  small bubbles dribble slowly up the sides of the glass.  lumpy craters appear as the head goes down.  aroma of sweet light malts and banana.  taste of dark fruit on the front end followed by some robust sweet malts.  a little thick in the mouth without the overpowering taste to back it up.  pretty tasty beer, but if i am going to drink an imperial stout i want it to be somewhat outstanding."

Fremont Dark Star,3.6,"deep opaque black color, ruby fringes exposed with a back-light. a tall, thick brown/tan creamy head that takes well into half the beer gone before it shrinks to a 1/4 inch of foam. even longer to shrink into a thick cap. it leaves a thick clinging lacing. aroma of roasted malts and coffee. taste is coffee, a touch bitter, initially, leading to a mild middle. rich and creamy, mouth feel has moderate body. predominate flavors are coffee, perhaps some chocolate, and roasty-smoky malts. the bitterness that starts with the initial taste fades in the middle, but then re-appears into the aftertaste. a very nice english-style stout, moderated by the oatmeal. too easy drinking for the abv, though, so be forewarned."

Fremont Dark Star,3.6,pour is a complete black with a super large tan head. aroma is a big time char malt with plenty of chocolate roasted malt. flavor is more roasted malt and chocolate with a syrupy mouth feel. if they made a bakers chocolate syrup it would be just like this beer. a little bitter and almost no sweetness. this is very rich and flavorful with the alcohol making just a bit of appearance.
Fremont Dark Star,3.6,really a very good imperial stout but it's a touch thin and a touch sharp. a little more on the sweet side and i would have preferred more balanced but still quite good. and drinkable.

Sierra Nevada / Brauerei Gutmann Oktoberfest (2024),4.0,"canned 6/27/24, drunk 9/8/24.
clear peach-honey-amber. small, off-white head, lower retention.
lots of biscuit with a bit of caramel-laced honey. clean, not overly aromatic. bit of subtle, spicy/herbal hop character, but it too is vague/mild.
nicely malty with quick bitterness on the edge of the palate. kind of vague and peppery flavor, however (though this was canned in late june (which, wtf?)). medium-light body, a bit toasty and abrupt on the finish with lingering sourdough, pepper and an all-around annoying, fizzy carbonation. not a real rich, supple malt base. very vapid. is clean, though. very low on flavors/aromatics for its size. have had many 4.0% lagers that have twice the flavor of this.

feels like sn is just going through the motions at this point. should be bankrupt or massively downsizing/selling out any day now."
Sierra Nevada / Brauerei Gutmann Oktoberfest (2024),4.0,"every fall i look forward to trying this beer, which seems to get better every year with the collaborated series. last year, in 2023, i gave a 4.5 overall rating to that version. now, let's see how the 2024 version, a collab with gutmann, stacks up.... 12-ounce can pours bright, clear, pale copper with a tiny white head with lacing; lots of visible carbonation rising quickly in glass. aroma: caramel, nuttiness, spiciness. flavor: caramel, toffee, biscuit, undetectable cake-like spices, vanilla beans, black pepper (super flavorful; flavor profile develops as it warms and i slowly sip and savor it -- although it could easily be chugged). mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied with a soft, creamy finish; toward the close the grassy hoppiness floats in to perfectly balanced out the sweetness; prickly carbonation on the tongue prevents the sweetness from becoming cloying. this marzen definitely drinks fuller than its abv would indicate."
Sierra Nevada / Brauerei Gutmann Oktoberfest (2024),4.0,"appearance: pours a tawny golden color with a medium-sized, white head.

smell: a welcoming note of bready malts with some snippets of sun-baked grassy herbs and a light clean yeast quality.

taste: crisp baked bread maltiness with a light, brief sweetness. grassy hops with a little spicy herbaceousness within. nice clean lager character. amply bitter this time around. finishes fairly clean with a little final snap of bitterness.

mouthfeel: medium-bodied. medium carbonation.

overall: quite pleasant. some years have been better than others, but they've all been really solid. thanks for not giving up on us, sn and going all-in on that lackluster na lineup or those canned mimosas."

Sierra Nevada / Brauerei Gutmann Oktoberfest (2024),4.0,"aromas are mild malt with hints of toffee and citrus. flavors are similar to nose, citrus comes out a bit more along with maybe some toast. not too traditional. drinkable but not my favorite style of octoberfest."
Sierra Nevada / Brauerei Gutmann Oktoberfest (2024),4.0,"12oz in mug.  bright gold with medium white foam.  subtle straw, cracker, and bakery aromas.  pleasant but unexciting rich beeriness, with no particular emphasis on any charismatic hop or grain or fermentation character.  lager hole is present, but the finish is not as indicatively snappy as sn house flavor usually manifests.  purchased from the unrefrigerated shelf of trader joe's, so perhaps a fresher, better-handled example would seem more inspired."

aroma:  slightly sweet with moderate scents of malt, bread, and caramel which is then followed by subtle hints of honey.  quite delightful!

appearance:  pours a clear light-gold color with a 3-finger, white, coarsely-frothy head, that dissipates slowly with good lacing.  it looks very nice in my clear, glass, pilsner.

taste:  i'm first hit with moderate sweetness and light flavors of malt, caramel, and honey.  which is then followed by some fleeting light bitterness and then finishes with a bit more sweetness.  overall, i find the flavor-profile to work very well.

note:  as the beer warms i get a little more sweetness as the honey becomes a bit more pronounced.  but at no point does it ever become overbearing.  even at room temperature, i would not classify this as anything more than moderately sweet.

mouthfeel:  medium-bodied with a somewhat smooth texture that gets a little ""grabby"" at times.  i would rate carbonation as a bit below average.  normally, i'm not a fan of beers this ""soft"".  but in this case, that ""softness"" seems to work as i think that more carbonation would only detract from the experience.  in other words, the ""soft"" flavors seem to match well with the ""soft"" feel.

overall:  i've only tried a few, new oktoberfest beers this year.  but this one is my favorite, so far.  this beer is so evenly balanced between the flavors, aroma, and mouthfeel that, as i sip it, i imagine that this is exactly the experience i would have if i were to imbibe at a beer tent in germany during oktoberfest.  prost!"

strong mineral character in the mouth with a well-attenuated, medium-light body and plentiful carbonation that is a bit overbearing at times. heavy hay and cracker with even a touch of toast from the malt balances against the spicy, floral and a touch citric hop character. lovely stuff and very easy to drink.  assertively hoppy without too much acid or pine/citrus."

Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"11.2 oz. bottle. pours black with deep red hues and a thick, pillowy tan head. aroma is boozy, with roasted malts, some coffee and caramel. lightly carbonated. very deep and rich flavor profile is immediately apparent. coffee, molasses, maple syrup and brown sugar are noted, but the blend is not overly sweet. dark fruits such as raisin, plum and fig. great roasted barley character. burnt toast. sugars are held at bay by serviceable bittering hops. warm and boozy. buttery, medium bodied mouthfeel. more helpings of coffee. the malt is just a work of art, with excellent punch and flavor. it is perfectly counterbalanced by roasted barley and hops to prevent it from being overly sweet. 6.7% alc/vol is just right for this style - not too weak or too strong. this is truly a beer lover s beer. a symphony of flavors. finishes with a hint of dry smoke. that amazing malt profile will have me reaching for celebrator again and again."
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"it pours a slightly reddish brown with a large tan, persistent head. it has a wonderful malty aroma and smells of dried fruit, chewy bread & fall leaves in rain with a hint of leather. this is malty goodness incarnate. i taste spices, dried fruit, leather, dark bread and wet leaves in fall. it has an exquisite rich full bodied mouthfeel. this was a real treat to try for the first time as a birthday present to myself. thanks ayinger!"

Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"magical labeling! when poured, I see a red-brown beer with an astonishingly high, but rather unstable, light brown head. the aroma test reveals an intense, dark malty-sweet and quite robust play of aromas. the very full, heavily dark malty first sip appears thick and creamy, the very low effervescence ensures a dangerous sweetness. shortly afterwards, a lovely, roasted malt aroma comes through, which is further enriched by some dried plum and dark bread. not too sweet and with the aromas of dried fruit and coffee, the roasted-tart aftertaste also leaves me completely satisfied. it is never fattening, and the 6.7% alcohol cannot be tasted in any way. delicious, incredibly runny and obviously flammable!"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"creamy nose with date and fig notes and a very slight roastiness. medium body, creamy mouth feel, moderate sweetness balanced by a slight bitterness and astringency. lingering finish. packs a lot of flavor and body into a 6.7% beer"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"what a wonderful beer, good malty body complex with yeasty notes and just a little dryness bitterness."
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"nice dark color, not a lot of head. deep, smoky flavor. not as sweet as other double bocks."
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"0,5 bottle (as ayinger winterbock) at home with snegurochka. brought back from riga where it was bought at alus celle. almost opaque mahogany body with small tan head that soon disappears leaving little or no lacing. strong but well balanced and very pleasant aroma of smoky sweetish malts, dark fruits (such as plums and dades), brown sugar and roasted coffee. flavour is also strong and immediate, and lingers for a decent amount of time for a brew at this strength. otherwise flavour is quite akin to aroma, although (and luckily) even less sweet, including notes of tobacco. in the aftertaste the coffee-similar bitterness is most strongly felt along with some roasted notes, giving an interesting journey from the relative sweetness of the aroma to the bitterness of the aftertaste.  excellent mouthfeel serves to convey the complexity of this eminently drinkables beer which - at least according to this reviewer - is a favourite, especially at the relatively low prices it can be found. great and highly recommended!"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"500ml bottle as ayinger winter bock from alus celle, riga. pours a mahogny body. ring around the rim. nose: plum, sweet liquorice, dates, prunes, and some light smoke. taste: more tobacco notes, sweet malts, and dark fruits. velvety and nice, and not too heavy. (shared w/thecellarer at home.)"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"The smell of toffee and strong malt with roasted aromas gives hope. The color is dark brown and the cappuccino-colored foam is medium-porous, lush and stable. When you first sip, you immediately get coffee aromas and dark chocolate with a heavy, bitter body. This makes the beer something for someone who needs a little warmth in winter and is happy with one or two beers at most in the evening. The hop bitterness comes through on the finish to make the taste a little more interesting. However, it is no longer dominant but only supports the taste, which is important for this type of beer. The high alcohol content of 6.7% is well integrated. You only taste it later on the palate together with coffee aromas. A great achievement to produce a dry bock despite such a high original gravity. I think it's great!

In 2016 I tasted the celebrator from the kalea advent calendar. It was my introduction to the world of good beer (I've drunk bad beer before). The rating at the time without a review was also good, now the retest with text. The lush, fine-pored and stable head is perfect. The opaque dark brown, almost black color together with the -ator in the name is evidence of a dark double bock. This has 6.7% alcohol. The smell is of toffee and coffee, great aromas on the first sip that almost completely cover the caramel taste but not quite. So the bock is only a little sweet, which I think is great. Also nuts, bread crust and dark chocolate. Nevertheless, the effervescence is in the middle range, the beer is not heavy, the body is rather light. Nevertheless, achieving this complexity is admirable. More aromatics and a light alcohol taste on the finish. Additional hop bitterness rounds off the overall work of art. A Doppelbock drinker can only be full of praise here. 05-2021"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"very crisp and clean tasting with a hint of sweetness. another thing i like about bocks is the lack of a strong hop taste and bite. pours a dark brown with a medium tan head. all german beers have a good mouthfeel, none feel really heavy and this is no exception. i really like bock style beers as they are not overly strong and go well in the spring or fall. purchased at total wine & more."
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"dark brown with a tan head and a malty nose. malty with a smooth mouthfeel and a long, caramel finish."
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"optically deep black! the brownish, almost creamy head has a very fluffy and long-lasting consistency. impressive! the aromas are incredibly complex with sweet, roasted and roasted-tart notes that are reminiscent of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, but also fruity components such as cherry, cassis, dried fruit, and also mon cheri. a woody, chestnut-like spice rounds off this profile perfectly! the first sip is soft, tangy and broadly aromatic, directly complex with light sweetness and a delicate bitterness. cocoa, chocolate, coffee - and subtle fruit. the spectacle continues on the palate or continues along the same line... all the aromas that you could already perceive on the nose are perceived exactly the same on the palate. the delicate sweetness, cocoa, chocolate, the light roastiness and bitterness of dark chocolate and mocha, the rich, overripe to dried fruit-like fruit aromas, ... everything is there! despite this complexity, this dark double bock remains incredibly easy-going and at no point seems alcoholic, spirity or heavy. the smooth and full mouthfeel is offset by a surprisingly good sweetness for this beer. someone has to try that! in the aftertaste you can review all the aromas again. at the beginning the fruity notes walk over the palate again. after that it remains sweet and bitter for almost an infinite amount of time... cocoa, chocolate and coffee dominate the proceedings.
conclusion: incredibly complex and balanced with only 6.7% alcohol. there is hardly any beer of this kind at this level. one of the very best beers in the world. and probably the best of its style!"
Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,[10/22] bottled 4/22. very dark red with a fat dense coat of beige head. oozing malty aroma with dark sugars and bread. smooth with modest carbonation. malty but only fairly sweet with dark sugars and hints of stewed fruit before bitterness and spices that lighten the load. has real presence without being too strong and remaining very drinkable.

Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock,3.7,"The Celebrator's label and the small plastic figure on the neck may seem a bit kitschy, but it just fits the old, venerable brewery in Aying.

In terms of taste, I have rarely experienced such a velvety, intense but nevertheless balanced Bock. The beer delivers the alcohol-laden fruit notes without falling too deep into the shot glass. There is also a fine maltiness that spreads pleasantly in the mouth.

Mount Saint Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,3.8,"bottle notes: 5/31/24 - (bottle - home) (chicago, il) - purchased from beer on the wall 5/30/24 for $6.83 at store temperature, refrigerated upon returning home until opening. 11.2 oz, no bottle date, best by date 8/8/26. 7.4% abv, strong beer/biere forte. english trappist ale. ingredients: water, barley malt, sugar, hops, yeast. strong ale brewed by the monks of mount saint bernard abbey, charnwood forest. product of uk. in the usa imported by: merhcant du vin corporation, tacoma, washington.

with this beer we have returned to a 19th-century tradition of brewing in our abbey. when our brethren arrived in 1835 they settled in a poor cottage on tynt meadow, now an extension of our monastic enclosure. this strong dark ale referments in the bottle. store in a cool, dark, quiet place. pour gently at 9 c.

appearance: dark bronze murky base, full head to start, retreats quickly to leave minimal thin lacing in the large tulip this bottle filled in a single pour, thin carbonation settles into a creamy tan caramel layer covering the base fully. 3.75

aroma: very malty first impression after allowing to warm for 15 minutes. raisins, dates, hints of baklava. strong and pleasant. 4.25

taste: malty malt malt. barley malt and sticky pudding what i get here, the complexity of the aroma gone and missed. 3.0

Mount Saint Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,3.8,"Dense and consistent amber appearance. Dense foam that leaves a long-lasting ring. Slightly marked aroma, somewhat plastic. Not very pleasant. In the mouth it has an excellent texture on the palate, really smooth and creamy. And the flavor is very pleasant, with toasted malts, a tone that is somewhat sweet without being cloying, and notes of coffee and cocoa."
Mount Saint Bernard Abbey Tynt Meadow English Trappist Ale,3.8,"mount saint bernard abbey's tynt meadow, while holding a unique place in the world of trappist beers, unfortunately, falls short of expectations in several areas, despite its commendable appearance. on the visual front, tynt meadow impresses with a deep, inviting mahogany color and a robust, creamy head that promises a traditional trappist experience. the beer's clarity and carbonation are on point, presenting an aesthetically pleasing pint that captures the eye and initially excites the palate.

however, the journey begins to diverge from the anticipated path upon first aroma. while one expects a blend of rich, complex scents, tynt meadow's bouquet is overwhelmingly dominated by a sharp, almost acrid coffee-like bitterness that masks the subtler notes one might hope to find. this singular aroma note hints at a lack of balance, setting the stage for the tasting experience.

the taste, much like the aroma, is heavily skewed towards a coffee-like bitterness that overpowers the palate. while some enthusiasts of dark, bitter beers might find this appealing, it detracts from the beer's potential complexity and harmony. the expected dark fruit undertones and the warmth of alcohol are overshadowed, making it challenging to appreciate the full range of flavors that a trappist beer traditionally offers.

the palate experience continues along the same vein, with the bitterness lingering far too long, overshadowing the beer's body and texture. instead of a balanced finish, one is left with a persistently bitter aftertaste that negates the initial visual appeal and anticipation. the mouthfeel, which should complement the beer's other characteristics, instead becomes another vector for the beer's overpowering bitterness.

in conclusion, while tynt meadow excels in appearance, offering a visual feast that raises expectations, it ultimately underdelivers in the crucial areas of aroma, taste, and palate. the overwhelming coffee-like bitterness detracts significantly from the overall experience, overshadowing the subtleties and balance that are hallmarks of trappist beers. for those seeking a complex, nuanced beer, tynt meadow may not meet these criteria, despite its promising presentation."

AleSmith IPA,3.6,"12 oz can canned in october 2017.

lightly hazed amber colored body topped by a large, creamy white head. very good retention with a foamy film of lacing left on the glass.

aroma: smells of tropical fruits including oranges, grapefruit, and a bit of pineapple. 

flavor: follows the aroma but negligible dankness, more complexity, bready malts, and hints of honey. some pine and grapefruit in the finish. moderately bitter for style but leans towards bold for style overall. 

feel: medium-full body; medium carbonation; semi-dry finish. 

overall: a high quality west coast ipa."

AleSmith IPA,3.6,"from feb 2008

purchased from hi time liquors.

it's been a long time since i last had any of the alesmith brews:

it pours a slightly hazy gold with a 1 finger head of foam. btw, great head retention and there's plenty of nice lacing!

the smell is lots of grapefruit and just a bit of malt hiding in the background.

the taste is beautifully hoppy...grapefruit and some floral notes tickle my taste buds but there's a good level of malty sweetness that stops this from becoming too bitter. nice medium to fullish mouthfeel here and the carbonation is medium as well. easy sipping and such a good thirst quencher, man this is a top notch ipa indeed....and..
i notice a touch of grass in the finish and the aftertaste is fairly long but definitely pleasing. also, despite it being 7.25%abv, i having *no* problem in making the contents of this 22oz bottle disappear. ;^)

for shame on me for not getting some for such a long time. it's truly worth the effort to get it *any* way you can because this ipa, imo, is a world class example of the style."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"(12 fl. oz. can) alesmith's reputation is surely second to none. and they aren't afraid to flaunt it - 'ipa' stands for 'it s pretty awesome'. i'd be inclined to agree.

the can opens violently, with smoke, foam, and fervour. pours a slightly-hazy golden beer, with vigorous streams of large bubbles, and a creamy, white, cappuccino-like head. the aroma is a hit of zesty citrus: grapefruit, orange pith, apricot kernel, cantaloupe, peach, floral notes, candied sugar, honey, and pine resin. smooth and creamy on the palate, with a moreish punch of back-end bitterness.

this is west coast ipa at its best. the flavours blend so beautifully well, making the beer not only complex, but a real pleasure to drink. highly recommended."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"grapefruit, tangerine, even some malty marmalade in the aroma. nice and fruity. taste is also nice, you can tell this is well made. caramel behind a tone of fruitiness, some grassy bitterness as well. slight piney, dry, bitter finish. smooth mouthfeel. a nice example of a balanced ipa."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"golden hazy colour. aroma flowery, spicy, citrus, tropical fruits and a bit grassy, biscuit, caramel. a bit malty as well. really balanced ipa, great beer overall."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"12 oz can. pours a hazy amber with full head. aromas of candied tropical fruit, spicy mangoes, pithy grapefruit, and sweet doughty malts. flavors of pine, sharp bitter pineapple, dry resin, and biscuity malts. expecting more from the nose. (and alesmith in general.) this is not a 100 rb. i think the name is getting the ratings..."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"dark golden color, large, white foam.

AleSmith IPA,3.6,"drank 15-09-17 @ 'csakaj s r kft' while writing. full-bodied for an ipa. quite malty all the way through. the beer is comprehensive, but not that fresh and hoppy for an ipa."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"one of the best west coast style ipas ever! light straw colored. piney, citrusy, with not much malt at all. quality hops all the way through. it was better in the bottle but took a step down when they switched to cans only. please ale smith go back to the bottles!"

AleSmith IPA,3.6,"yes yes yes, this is what i mean people! a clear and smooth ipa as they were meant. somehow most breweries aren t able to make this, but alesmith makes this perfect blend to the max. it has full ripeness and citrus flavors, but without the pronounced bitterness and nastyness that comes along with it in all usual ales. it is almost forced to the back because of this smooth layout. it must be the water i guess and how its get treated. but for sure the freshness of the products and hops. beautiful beer, one of the best ones i ve tasted ever."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"fairly amazing ipa, a killer mix of citrus-pine hop notes and a rich, grainy malt base. starts with a swipe of lemon-orange hoppiness coupled to a thick, semisweet caramel backbone, then grows resinous and tropical with waves of pine and pineapple flowing over an earthy, bitter finish. classic west coast ipa nose, piney and mildly citric with an underlying malt sweetness. pour is gorgeous, coming out of the can a clear gold with an ample white head and layer upon layer of lace. creamy texture stays just perky enough to keep the hefty ibus from lingering too long on the palate. absolutely delicious beer."
AleSmith IPA,3.6,"bomber. tropical fruit hop aroma with notes of melon, grapefruit, tangerine and pine resiny hops. pours golden amber colored with a enormous tan head that has excellent retention and some lacing. starts with grapefruit and tangerine citrus hop flavors with notes of melon and tropical fruit. finishes dry and quite bitter with pine resiny hop flavors and a touch of grapefruit citrus acidity with the piney hops providing a quite bitter ending. pretty nice ipa."

halloween 2022. little bottle, unfiltered, bbe 7th feb (eight months ago), from lowcostbeer. cracking beer! good sturdy classic malt (marris otter) with some corking fuggles hops from the 120 year old hukins hop farm in kent. this is a classic best bitter - truly great. does everything it is supposed to. great body, beautifully thirst quenching, eminently satisfying, oodles of character, bags of well balanced flavour, and enough hop bite to satisfy the most trendy of hop heads. aroma is, of course, a little stake, given the age - but that's not the brewer's fault, and i like a bit of vintage in my beer. drunk fresh this would be a beer for any true beer lover, traditional or modern. well made and gorgeous.  i like my beers to be stronger, and with less hops, but i do like this. mine was just called five points best, but it did explained that it was made with fuggles.

orange, juicy body, with a medium, fluffy, slightly yellow head. 
lovely, characterful aroma of dankness, cereals, grass, minerals, pine needles, lemon juice, mango, lychee, slight vanilla. 
tastes similar, a bit less diverse. 
medium, a bit oily mouthfeel, with an average carbonation. 
finishes perfect, crisp, medium dry, moderate bitter, piney, tangy, oaty, lemony, a bit mineralic. 

delicious! my highlight is the nose, which is surprisingly complex, with a great mix of juicy, hoppy and tangy notes. drinks really fresh and balanced, with just enough malt body and a super-crisp finish. beautiful stuff, my favourite tree house so far.

Tree House Bright,4.3,"tree house gets straight to the point with bright. its name lets you know exactly what kind of ipa this is, and like the brewery's other ipa with an apt name, haze, this ale absolutely delivers on what is promised. pour is yellow, hazy, and sudsy. simply gorgeous florals and fruits in the aroma. vibrant flavor profile is big on tangy-sweet intensity but lacks true bitterness. mango, melon, pineapple, clementine, papaya, and apricot tastes. of course, this wouldn't be a mosaic-forward beer without a healthy dose of oily, leafy maryjane character. happily i live several state away from this goodness. it would be all too easy to drink yourself into happy delirium with a lot of these at your side."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"can at home. pours a bit cloudy, almost clear, golden with a medium white head. juicy and dank with tropical fruits and citrus together with some herbal and floral notes."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can to teku from a trade. aroma of earthy, danky hops. light cat and skunk, in a good way. hazy orange ish pour with a large, tight bubbled head. taste is similar to aroma, danky, light tropical hop notes with a pleasant underlying malt that isn t quite sweet or bready, but enough to let you know this hop bomb isn t too obnoxious. maybe its some wheat or oats for the mouthfeel, but the color indicates there is something a little more than that. finished clean with a pleasant fading hop flavor and not a pithy astringency like moron beers. nice stuff."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"big funky tropical fruits, citrus aromas. yellow orange with white head. soft citrus bitter almost pine apple bite. soft and creamy. fruity herbal after taste."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"pours only a slightly hazy, golden yellow, with good-sized, pillowy head. aroma is dank, with loads of citrus and piney hops. flavor mirrors the aroma: lots of citrus, just a touch of sweetness, and a strong pine-spruce hop bite. very nice beer."

appearance - the body is slightly hazed amber. the head is 2+"" and off-white, the head fades into a fluff of foam.
taste - has a pleasant mix of flaked oat, citrus hops with notes of: lemon, mango, starfruit, pineapple. there are also floral and herbal hops. there is a slight dash of vanilla.
palate - medium body, slightly creamy, carbonation is average, the finish is dry and juicy."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"a little cleaner as less heavy and juicy than some of their other big hoppy beers. a little stank and darkness with the tropical fruit and marmalade aroma and flavor. light to moderate bitterness and very crushable for a double, though the abv is in between."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"pours a lightly hazed orange gold, satisfyingly non-murky for a change. nose is more typical tree house though -- light tropical fruits (passion fruit, mango, even coconut) and some floral hoppy aromas. enjoyable. mouth is assertive upfront with lots more of those tropical fruits, transitioning into a pleasant hoppy ending. this is different than the other tree house ipas i ve had -- not as ""round"" as i call them, not as soft, and more assertive. it s actually more of a traditional dipa, and a good one!"
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can shared. clear pale golden pour with a tall white head. notes of malts, citrus hops, a bit of dank cellar, honey. smooth texture, medium to light body, low carbonation and a spicy bitter-sweet finish. a very good example of the classic ipa."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"pours a lightly hazy golden with a small white head that leaves good lacing. nose is of onion, diesel and oranges. taste is quite bitter but not harsh with a moderate sweetness. more onion with a slight garlic character even now. not too boozy which is nice. moderate body and carbonation. slightly juicy. overall a pretty nice iipa that could be just a little lighter/more drinkable perhaps but that is my only nitpick about it."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can (473 ml), shared. almost clear bright orangey-golden with a medium white head leaving good lacing. aroma is ultra dank / diesel with pineapples, herbal notes and mild spiciness. taste is a bit sweet with dankness, pineapple, some herbalness, mild spiciness and low to moderate bitterness. medium body, medium carbonation. dank finish. good iipa but not up to tree house standards."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"475 ml can during my vacations. hazy golden color with white head. hoppy and light malty aroma, grass, pine, light weedy, citrus and tropical fruits, grapefruit and pineapple, light caramel. sweet and bitter taste like aroma. medium oily body with soft carbonation."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"appearance: hazy pale amber with one fat finger of creamy ivory head, good retention and lacing. (4/5) aroma: short-lived resiny pine, tropical fruit, citrus, herbal, pale malt. (9/10) taste: moderate sweet, moderate-high bitter. (8/10) medium body, moderate carbonation, drying slightly sticky finish. (4/5)

if you have the means to enjoy one of these at less than a week old, i highly recommend it. the flavour profile, particularly the aromas, changes fairly dramatically as the beer warms: upon initial opening, a sharp (and yes, dare i say, bright) resiny pine fills the room, but this shortly fades to be replaced by a pleasant blend of tropical fruit and citrus, with an herbal edge. on the tongue, a moderate-high bitter remains throughout, but the character changes somewhat from an herbal, almost grassy note, to a hint of not-quite-onion. (none of the cattiness i sometimes get with mosaic, though.) not sure why they consider this to be a double at 7.8% abv, while their green, at 7.5%, is not, but in any case it doesn t come across as one: the bitterness is big but not overwhelming, the body is soft and pleasant, and the abv is completely absent on the nose or the tongue. a very enjoyable dipa. (17/20)"

Tree House Bright,4.3,"fresh can. this wrapped up a long day of ipa tastings, so my taste buds were pretty shot, but it still managed to overwhelm. great, fruity hop aromas and a super soft mouthfeel. what do you know -- another excellent ipa from tree house."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"this cannot be true. the beer is filtered and therefore crystal clear, showcasing a big, froth head.

a thick resinous sweetness dominates the nose with a more subdued fruitiness underneath. fresh cut grass and shallot provide a herbal quality which finds its antagonist in a bubble gum sweetness. 

drinks very soft and creamy with a pleasant dryness during the finish, handling the piney sweetness very well. drinks very easy for an iipa with a pleasant balance to it. certainly unusual for this brewery, regarding the beers flavor profile, since it misses the typical juice aspect, replaced by a clean blend of herbs and resin.

tastes of a pungent blood orange bitterness together with pine needles, wet leaves, lemonade and white bread malts. easy on the tongue, this provides a nice complexity, drawing its power from bitter aspects, which get entangled marvelously well into sticky sweet resin and ripe oranges. finishes dry and bitter with an untamed noble quality still being recognizable among cakey malts, lime zest and tangerine peel.

completely unusual for this brewery, this is their first hoppy beer with the malts being recognizable on the nose, as well as in the taste. this creates much more of a classical ipa approach with the malts finding a dry and bitter antagonist in the hops, building up some tension which gets soothed by even more malts during the finish, respecting the balance of the beer. very intriguing and challenging while this certainly does not act as one of their typical, harmonious juice bombs."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"16 oz. can. canned on 5/19/2016. imbibed and rated on 5/20/2016. gold/orange with a white head. aroma is very fruity with tropical fruit, peach, pineapple and hints of pine. similar taste. very juicy and well-balanced. abv not noticeable. fantastic."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"the bright reveals a golden yellow color, a great effervescence and beautiful carbonation. far from being the hoppiest dipa that i have encountered in my life. we first notice its malty character and its yeast. the hops are really in the background, more resinous, more bitter. the mosaic is not the aromatic hop with the greatest presence in the mouth in my experience, and this is revealed by being quite discreet with the yeast and the malt."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can care of albert, pours carbonated and clear gold with small white head. onion and skunk, not sweet but a touch hot being 7.8. also some orange but she s a little too cheesy and thick like most trendy imperials. tree house has been underwhelming me recently"
Tree House Bright,4.3,"pours a hazy orange/gold with thick slightly off white head with absolute tons of lacing. aroma is just like the name - bright! lots of grass initially, but then you get citrus, berries. taste is dank, with a balanced mix of resin, citrus, and a touch of spruce. carbonation is light and prickly and finish is long and smooth. very very nice."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"can in a tulip. pours golden/amber for a white head. aroma of citrusy and fruity but definitely mosaic hops, some pale and caramel malts, and some dough. flavor the same with a nice blend. average texture. good but maltier than most th ipas and mosaic hops are not my favorite."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can, less than four weeks old, by way of trade with henriko. cheers henrik! poured clear gold, until i tipped in the sediment. thin, dense, sticky, white head. nose has stone fruit, hop juiciness. some overripe citrus fruit. a bit piny and dank. the malt comes over sweet and juicy, too. taste is soft, fruity sweet. turns earthy, stone fruit bitter. nice mouthfeel. full and juicy. finishes all of that, with a touch of dryness right on the close. never entered my head that this is nearly 8%. chugged it in no time. nice one."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can. 8 days old. clean golden with a thin white head, fading quickly. bright tangerine aromas, not much else. light bodied, prickly carbonated, fairly bitter with a bitter orange feeling, tangerine, citrus finish. thirst quencher with a straightforward citrussy bitterness. good."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"ah why brew a clean beer? thats not you treehouse! this one has some alcohol flavors in it. the mosaic hops are killing it though, definitely showing the citrus and hop profile."

Tree House Bright,4.3,"can. poured a pale, slightly hazy yellow with a foamy white head. pretty clear looking for a th beer. aroma was sweet smelling, pineapple, citrus. flavor was tropical and pineapple up front, some lemon, sweet malts. my tastes may have been off that day even tho this was my first beer. everyone else said i was crazy and it was good. i love mosaic, but i didn t get the usual dank, onion that i normally do and mostly what i got was really sweet. i ll have to revisit with another can to see. lighter and thin body and texture. bubbly carbonation, sweet finish. has been my least favorite from them so far, but i ll update if i get anything different from the next can."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"poured from a 16-oz can. a slightly hazy grassy yellow color with a thin off-white head. sweet herbal-grassy aromas and flavors. bits of earth, citrus and tropical fruit. lingering bittersweet finish. a little too much sweetness for my liking though."
Tree House Bright,4.3,straight mosaic joose. cloudy peach color with frothy white head. aroma is tropical fruit stone fruit citrus and scallion. taste is fruity light sweet up front with a finish that tastes like straight onion body odor. good beer all the way through until the big time mosaic bo on the finish.

Tree House Bright,4.3,"very nice smooth, floral and hoppy. not as malty as a typical imperial but still really smooth. march madness 2016"
Tree House Bright,4.3,pours golden peach with a nice white head. aroma brings delicious pungent armpit stinky mosaic hops that i love with just a kiss of sweetness. flavor is even more delicious bringing sweet and smooth hops with some light citrus lime notes that settle nicely with just enough dryness that is not overbearing.
Tree House Bright,4.3,"17 oz can from eddie. the pour is a darker golden orange and a little clearer than most tree house ipas. there is a nice white head that froths down to a film leaving a heavy dose of soapy lacing. the aroma is very bitter and dank. it's a lot different than the other ipas i've had. there is a leafy hop presence and a lot of bitter dank resin. it's surprisingly good. there is a hint of bitter popcorn in it, but for the most part, it's incredibly dank and bitter. the flavor is weird. there is a leafy hop and a dank leafy green to fm go with a little resin. there is a buttery popcorn poking through again, and i'm not feeling that. i do like the light crisp leafy hop and the dank resin. it's just a bit off through. the mouth feel is light and crisp with a nice carbonation. it's spot on really. there is a nice lingering leafy hop aftertaste and a little bitterness. it's got a great mouth feel, but i think this might be the worst tree house beer i've had."
Tree House Bright,4.3,"can shared with koleminer20. aroma is very dank, resinous, popcorn butter, tropical fruit, pine, earthy hops, weed. appearance is amber golden, white head, hazy, as with all tree house ipas. taste is resinous, pine, earthy hops, popcorn butter, light tropical fruit, different. mouthfeel is light to medium body, crisp carbonation, lots of earthy hops in the aftertaste. overall, pretty good but disappointing for tree house."
Tree House Bright,4.3,juicy. tangerines. subtle orange. fairly mild ipa. tasted in line at a sp release.
Tree House Bright,4.3,"750 ml growler from blisscent filled 2/19/16 and drunk 2/20/16.
solidly hazy, though not soupy pour is a soft apricot-golden and shows a moderately well-retained white head atop.
fruity and juicy, of course, with lychee, pineapple, kiwi and starfruit. that s all quite nice, but true to mosaic, there s a strong apricot character that, in concert with the sweetness from the malts, significantly lessens the brightness. it just comes off rather ""mushy-sweet"". light earthiness, bits of herbs and some light to moderate pine.
in the flavor, again, it s got some doughy malt character with sweetness combining with the strong apricot-nectarine notes to create not nearly as bright a flavor as this could be. needs to be a touch more dry with a little less pine and earth. of course, this is holding the beer to the very highest standards, being from treehouse, and in an overall sense, it s still fantastic."
WeldWerks Starry Noche (2021),4.4,"backlog 12/19/2021: 2021 bottle shared. thanks adam! pours a thick and viscous deep brown to back with a finger brown head that lingers. lovely notes of hazelnut, coconut and dark chocolate and bourbon. palate is very similar with loads of hazelnut syrup and dark chocolate. coconut lingers on the finish with deep bourbon and oak notes."

weldwerks brewing company - starry noche batch 2 (2021)

styl: imperial stout

alkohol: n/a

release date: 4th of september 2021

this year's version continues that amazing base 'noche pedigree with stout aged an average of 25 months (some as old as 33 months) in barrels that include old weller antique 107, george dickel 11-yr bottled in bond, blanton s original single barrel (8-yr), limited edition knob creek kentucky straight bourbon (15-yr), woodford reserve master's collection chocolate rye (6-yr) and old forester 1910 double barrels. 
after all that extended aging and subsequent multi-step blending, the finished base was conditioned on more than 3 lbs/gallon of toasted coconut flakes and raw coconut chips (read: an absolute ton of coconut), then finished with toasted hazelnut. as much as we loved the 2020 version of this beer, 2021 has captured our hearts and palates even more, and we couldn't be more stoked to send this follow-up out into the world.

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"vintage 2016 (foeder n 222). mahogany red color typical of the style. the nose hints at the coming acidity and woody notes. on the palate, we find the sweet and sour side of the rodenbach but with a more pronounced woody side. if the attack is rather on the acidity, there remains a sweet side which quickly counterbalances this first impression. the whole keeps a sweet, fruity and refreshing side. a very nice rodenbach for flanders lovers."
Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"vintage 2016 - foeder n 222 (drunk in august 2022). drunk in a wine glass. dark brown, no foam, a few bubbles on the sides of the glass, but little carbonation. woody nose, rich, complex, hint of sweetness and chocolate. woody attack. the sugar is not negligible, a candied side, but also balsamic vinegar. sweet and not too acidic. the sugar is well present but not excessive, surprising. the wood is controlled and not too astringent, and the long aging attenuates the overly gripping aromas to leave room for subtlety. very delicate. all in style."
Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"vintage bottle 2016 foeder 222. brown color, like old gold or copper, almost without foam. the vinegary aroma floods your nose, with notes of berries, vanilla, wood. in the mouth we have a bittersweet profile, red fruits, spices and a dry finish. this red from flanders is complex and very fine."

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"vintage bottle 2012, drunk after more than 10 years and 5 years after the expiration date (!). red color tending towards brown, clear, topped with a light head of whitish and dense foam a little crackling and leaving a small ring. aromas that seem to still hold, lots of cherry with also balsamic vinegar, blackcurrant, red wine, old sweet wood, caramelized scents. in the mouth, it holds just as well, again this cherry side well in the foreground, light pleasant residual sugar, blackcurrant liqueur, apple, some caramelized flavors, balsamic vinegar but no sensation of rasped throat, a little chocolate even. finish a little more woody but barely, vinous even if we do not have real flavors of red wine, cherry tannins. winey texture, low carbonation and medium thin body. excellent even if I have no comparison in terms of freshness. let's just say that despite the age, the flavors are still on point. even better even when closer to room temperature."

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"low-foam red ale with a lovely alluring aroma of plums and blackcurrants. the taste is very vinous and full-bodied with distinct notes of fresh plums, blackcurrants and a little cherry. it has an exquisite acidity that contrasts nicely with the fruity sweetness. oak tastes a little through, along with a little vanilla in the aftertaste. the carbonation is low and almost non-existent. it should not be enjoyed too cold and it is definitely a beer that deserves attention and thus should be enjoyed slowly."

2007 vintage - bottled; was:  7/4/8/4/14~3.7good, lightly cream-coloured head over deep, dark, chestnut-brown beer. sour, wood, and some artificial sweetness in the nose, totally unlike the c reale, sweet-lactic, like coffeemilk. sourish, with a taste as from  speculoos , fairly sweet, and lightly spicy. lactic acid again. faint astrigency, ""mildered"" by whatever is added - still dry-out effect, but tame. it still is a nice beer. but compared to the ""vin de c reale"", it is a total dumb-down. why the colouring, why the sweetener - certainly not for the american customers, asking for alexander, no?

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"vintage 2007. barrel no. 230 - dark 750ml bottle from beer planet (in november 2011). five years aged in my dark cellar (taste in november 2016). long acid and fruit finish, but it was sour wild, lively, very fruity, wild cranberries, forest berries, black and red currants and lots of cherries. sour aftertaste, incredibly dry sometimes it made your mouth twist and want more. dark burgundy color with negligible, and practically zero foam. close to the dry most noble wines. at the end it leaves a cherry balsamic viscosity in the mouth. classic and powerful sour ale. for me one of the best ale in the world. i'm love it and die for this.

vintage 2013. foeder no. 149. - white 375ml limited edition bottle. from regional beers in katowice. what's going on here.. soaked barrel wood for two years in impressive 59-year-old barrels did its job, I should actually write good job. tannins everywhere, as many as gray hairs on santa's beard. smells amazingly of good wine vinegar. chestnut-rusty color, clear, no foam, vanilla notes, apricot pits, a bit of tart cherries, sourdough from beetroot. phenomenal flanders red.

vintage 2016 foeder no. 222. half champagne bottle. this year that flanders red won two world beer awards. well, if it was so good in 2016 as a fresh one, will it be even better after 5 years. flanders ages perfectly, and rodenbach is an icon of style it is mega winey, balsamic vinegar, crushed into a pulp black tart currants, a bit of cherry. very winey, medium foam, falls quickly, clear red-brown color. smells of wood, wet old wood, it is not surprising because as we know rodenbach has over 100 year old barrels, it is cellar-like, a bit stable-like. simply wonderful. for Sunday dinner, and especially kimchi salad it went perfectly. this edition and this vintage have the soul of burgundy for sure. gold label, or rather the whole bottle apt for gold awards and medals. earlier rating: 2/7/2012 total score: 5"

the aroma in the glass is much deeper and has a tonne of wine and deep fruit notes, and a hint of something like a bubblegum if i'm being fanciful and wordy.

this is drop dead gorgeous to drink, there's an outstanding level of bitterness that is carried on a much lighter fruit cushion with quite a high sugar hit to finish and fall away easily, to a smile.  making my lips i can't help but pucker and squint a little at that sourness, in a good way not that one of aghast and horror.  this is really enjoyable beer."

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"7%abv.   flanders red ale

poured out brown.  28 srm.

nose has aromas of stone fruit preserves referencing dates, plums, and prunes.  background notes of barnyard funk are there with horseblanket, dirty straw, mud.  there are also pleasant confectionery aromas referencing chocolate cherries, candied orange, and candied ginger.   there are also aromas that suggest cookies and baked goods in the background, that give the impression of cake and fullness in the nose.

mouthfeel is medium-full with moderate-low carbonation.  there is a balanced fruitiness to the palate that makes each sip smooth, refreshing, and inviting.   there is some residual sweetness that contributes to the impression of full ripe stone fruit.  alcoholic vapor with slight warmth belie the abv.

palate for me has 3 main components: 
front is sweet and fruity with honey plums, raisins, ripe sweet prunes, fresh dates, with components that suggest pome fruit like a ripe red delicious, and anjou pears.
middle is sour suggesting vinegar aged on wood where there is the rounded acidity and a woody perfume-like flavor impression. 
tail is the alcoholic and almost solvent-like heat, vapor, and bite. 
there are also basenotes of breadcrusts, toast, pie crusts.

hop flavors are woody and maybe even a little cheesy. 

finish is pleasing, smooth, even, balancing satiety and appetite. 

overall, a deeply pleasing quaff.  one of my recent epiphanies.  not surprising given my experience with all of rodenbach s offerings so far, and that the grand cru has always been a go to favorite. really really pleasing.  i just can t use that word enough...the product of experience, patience, and restraint.

2009 vintage. regular beer drinkers at my session hated the stuff but i still loves me a fine belgian sour ale. the aroma is a nice mix of vinegar and malt, the appearance a nice deep brown. the flavour is a sour mix with beer, a gueuze-like concoction that works just right in the friday night fog. rodenbach can t do wrong in my books and this is a fine sour ale. but it is not what it isn t: if that makes sense."
Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"750 ml bottle from rbc.  reddish amber color with no head.  aroma is quite acidic and sour.  cherries and white wine.  lightly effervescent.  semi-sweet.  pleasantly tart cherries, pastry, apple cider vinegar, caramel malts.  dry finish."

almost clear deep purple color with a off white layer on top. good intensity in the aroma. medium + body and a soft carbonation level. oily texture. pleasant acidity and a fine mellow sweetness. vinegar, cherries and oak are dominating the flavor. nice tasty evening sipper. probably a bit to much vinegar. 2013 version.

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"16th march 2020; chez sophie, shrewsbury monthly beer exchange. cheers simon for this 75cl bottle. red hue to the clear brown body, off-white topping. almonds and old cherries in the nose and tart taste, plenty of maltiness in there too. i am beginning to warm towards this style of beer, especially the ones that are not 'sour'.

2007 bottle, slightly out of date when shared at the 1st shrewsbury bottle swap on 27th jan 2014.

all four of us enjoyed it: one of my contributions.

i thought it was a lovely mellow brew, the oak aging and time in the bottle calmed down the usual rodenbach tartness.

poured that wonderful reddy brown only belgian sour reds seem to be able to find, on top a thin blush coloured head.

the nose took in sour cherries, cranberries and woody notes with a mild vinegar hint.

taste wise it showed what aging in oak can do: obviously full of old cherries and sourness it seemed smooth, settled and with a sweet undertone, almost more like cherry pie than sour cherries. a true classic and a beer i m sure will age well should anyone be brave enough to keep any for a few more years.

a delight to drink with other people who appreciate good beer."

2007 vintage (barrel no: 230) at the 1st shrewsbury bottle share jan 14, courtesy of blackhaddock. judging by the comments below i think i should ve taken more notes! a cherry tartness dominates the palette with cough syrup, red wine and sour notes evolving the taste the more it breathes. sweet, tangy moments towards the end before that cherry tartness gives you one last kiss on the cheeks."

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"A barrel-aged sour ale (the year tells you when it was bottled) that was just too strong for me when I first drank it in 2013. The intense bourbon and wood aromas knocked me off my feet so that I couldn't get up quickly. It would still be too strong for me, but I have to admit that it's just right for people looking for that special aromatic kick.
Not for the classic beer drinker, but for the cognac and whiskey lover."
Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"shared 750 ml. bottle signed by the brewer, and poured to a snifter showing a clear, burgundy color, with a presentable layer of off white froth, and dots & dashes of lacing. the nose was mild funk, woodiness, and esters as berry, cherry, grape, and dark/dried fruit. better than medium bodied, with decent spritz to the effervescence, the taste was as the aroma, adding some sweetness, balanced by tartness & tanginess, then some booze, and fruity & tannic astringency. appreciated the added complexity of the foeder aging.

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"2012 bottle. the colour on this is amber-brown, just a little bit of haze, probably just chill haze. no head, and when the cork popped it was actually fairly quiet. the aroma has bit oaky notes, deep sourness, veering towards balsamic notes. the mouthfeel is a bit flat, actually, and heavy on the aged vinegar, with some fruity notes like strawberries. seems like it might have picked up some aged notes over the years. in a sense, i'd say this is a fairly strong, pure expression but it is making me think a blend might be preferred, at least in this case, at this age."

Rodenbach Vintage,3.8,"from the cork, wine and vinegar.

from the bottle, a lot of red wine and vinegar, and also spices and accents that remind me of mulled wine; a bit heavy.

from the glass, the aroma is already nicely arranged; there is a light vanilla, barrel and wood accents, tannins, as well as grapes and cloves.

very nice foam, better than in Alexander, but it goes down quickly; the beer is also darker.

in taste... mmm! great balance; red wine mixes with vanilla known from Alexander, everything is decorated with greater acidity than in the aforementioned, to this there are pleasant notes of tannins, wood and grapes. all this is somehow better arranged, more fitting for me in terms of profile, it reminds me of Duke of Flanders brewery schalpiw.
maybe a slightly longer and more intense finish is missing, but the whole composition is light and airy."

De la Senne Brett Porter,3.8,"brettanomyces, the wild yeast strain now so beloved among beer lovers, was first discovered in aged english porter (hence  brettanomyces , meaning  british yeast ) and this historical fact seems to have inspired brasserie de la senne to let a lambic-derived brett loose on a porter.  moussy, dense, membrane-like lacing, pale yellowish beige, stable head on a dark chocolate brown beer with ruby red glow, turning misty with sediment.  aroma indeed combining classic porter aspects with a dash of brett  wildness , wet leather, dried plum, coffee grounds, medlar, iron (haemoglobin), roasted walnut, black tea, mugwort, toast, rosehip, old dry liquorice.  lightly fruity, restrainedly sweetish onset, notes of appe peel, dried plum and lingonberry, lively carbonated in a refined way, very smal-bubbled; smooth, bit oily but also somewhat thinnish mouthfeel, fondant chocolate and toast with a hard-caramelly core, roasted with coffeeish bitterness towards the end.  meanwhile this iron-like aspect develops and remains relatively distinct, but in a natural, elegant way (blood, rosehip); leathery and peppery brett effects add dryness, complexity and a touch of  wildness  retronasally without overpowering too much, even though the brett is very present and recognizable.  spicy, rooty hops in the finish further accentuate dryness and bitterness, but the whole remains remarkably smooth and easily drinkable.  oldskool porter feel for sure, but with the ageing potential of  bretted  beers in mind, one can wonder how this may evolve in the coming few years"

Sierra Nevada / Kehrwieder Oktoberfest Festbier (2023),3.7,"hooray!!  sierra nevada is doing collaboration brews for oktoberfest again!   and this one is a definite winner!  starts off with a nice malty aroma with that creamy, almost vanilla, quality and a light german lager yeastiness and a very faint green hoppiness.  the body is ever-so-slightly hazy with a beautiful medium amber/copper color and a foamy white head driven by some serious carbonation.  the first sip brings all of the aroma components into focus on a solid bready/biscuity malt body.  caramel and vanilla sweetness pop out with a bit of candy sugar.  there's a definite green leaf and pine hop flavor to balance the sweetness, but the roasted malt flavor prevails over this as soon as it rises up.  that bitterness does stick around on the tongue though and builds as you drink leaving a dry, leaf taste which is good, but maybe a bit much for an oktoberfest.   along with that bitterness, there's a lasting vanilla and toasted wood flavor left behind and all of it melds into a delicious finish.   congrats to sierra nevada and kehrwieder for creating an excellent festbier for 2023!"

soft and rich with a pleasing toasted graininess that helps balance the soft honey and white bread. sourdough, herb and pepper lingering with assertive hops. filtered texture is slightly underwhelming, but at least the malt is deep and the beer is well-attenuated and clean.  perhaps they've got just a bit carried away with the hop (especially the bitterness).  this is a month and a half old and it's very hoppy and very bitter for the style."

Baladin Xyauyù Fumé (Islay Whisky),3.7,"one of several highly acclaimed variants on baladin s classic  macro-oxidized , undercarbonated barleywine with the unpronounceable name   this time aged on islay (peated) whisky barrels.  comes from a 50 cl bottle from 2015 (according to the label) with cork and wax, packed in a fancy wooden case with informative leaflet inside   i guess this elaborate packing helps to justify the price tag   shared with my girlfriend on a snowy and icy winter night, which seemed the perfect occasion for this kind of beer.  some loose, large, yellowish-ochre bubbles form during pouring, but these vanish in instants, rendering this beer effectively  headless  (as intended); very deep and warm bronze-brown robe with copper-red glow.  intense nose, blending peat with sweetness: smoked peat or indeed islay whisky, pipe tobacco, lots of vanilla-scenting oak wood, old tawny port,  boerenjongens , candied cherry, walnut liqueur, bonfire, caramel sauce, leather, clove, shoe polish,  sirop de li ge , almond and   warming up   barbecue sausages or even faint smoked bacon.  very sweet onset, candied cherry, pear syrup, liquor-steeped raisins, brown sugary stickiness even, no carbonation; full, vinous mouthfeel, the sugars adding  fullness  and stickiness to a caramelly and brown-bready malt core showing excessive, but in this case highly elegant maderisation, as intended, resulting in a strong association with fortified wines (old port, madera or marsala).  the oak wood counters this a bit, but provides its typical vanilla-ish scent more than drying tannins; balance primarily comes from the smoky peated aspect, which strongly returns retronasally, even shifting from the old peat to a whiff of smoked bacon (as in rauchmalz) eventually.  hop bitterness remains low, while this whisky booziness provides lots of welcoming warmth, a feeling highly enhanced by the smoky aspect   this is indeed the ideal beer to be enjoyed on a winter night next to the fireplace.  old port, candied fruit and brown sugar sweetness remains the dominant factor till the very end, though, imparting drinkability a bit, but then a beer intended to be sipped slowly does not necessarily need a high degree of drinkability, perhaps.  in any case a wonderful combo of meaty and spicy smokiness with strong, liqueurish sweetness   a lovely marriage of flavours indeed (reinforcing my idea that smokiness is better combined with sweetness than with e.g. sourness).  wonderful brew, in all, even after six years of ageing (or perhaps due to the ageing)   salute, teo musso!"

Tree House Julius,3.7,"julius will always be love at first sip for me. in fear of sounding too biased, this beer always comes through for me through better or worse. but let s take a closer objective look at it, shall we?

pours a lovely deep yellow - almost orange-y - with a somewhat  rocky stable off-white head. the east coast homeland is further accentuated with a slight haze, making this a perfect visual example of a fruity east coast brew. the aromas are tropical with tangerine, mango, pineapple and passion fruit on the nose. 

the juicy tropical aromas are present as well right from the first sip. remember, tree house does not label julius a new england ipa themselves - only ipa. nevertheless, the tropical palate is a powerful force in this one. quite a lot of sweetness - maybe a bit too much for some people but it does tickle my taste buds in the right way though. finishes off with a pleasant bitterness and herbal notes with a medium carbonation as well as a smooth and oily mouthfeel. 

canned 07/03/23; enjoyed 04/04/23"
Tree House Julius,3.7,"the aroma hits you immediately: passion fruit, papaya, mango, peach, hints of dank earthiness. slightly watery in the mouth, perhaps too much, tropical fruit salad and not very present bitterness, very sweet with a dry but not very dry finish. drinkability at the highest levels, but not a masterpiece."
Tree House Julius,3.7,"yellow/orange colored cloudy beer with a 2 finger thick white foam collar of fine structure that stays for a long time. fruity aromas of passion fruit and especially mango. the taste also has this fruitiness with a nice balance between the fruitiness, the creamy mouthfeel and the bitter aftertaste to finish it off."
Tree House Julius,3.7,"rating #4000. medium cloudy orange to orange-brown body, thick puffy cream head. aroma mostly pink grapefruit and orange with lighter notes of passionfruit, bubblegum, and light herbal elements. body initially crisp with a blend of passionfruit, pineapple, pink grapefruit, and orange, with a doughy, gummy middle and a drier citrus resin finish. refined and lovely. this is a fitting tribute to this milestone, as hazy ipas have really rejuvenated my interest in craft beer over these past couple years."

Tree House Julius,3.7,"can from a friend.  gold with a bit of orange and gray.  very cloudy.  one inch of cream-colored head that is frothy and fades moderately fast to a thin pillowy  layer. aroma hits me right away - pineapple, orange, guava, lime, some of unripe lemon, bit of unripe mango, bit of pine and forest, some bready dough smell with a touch of yeast.  later, i get a note of red wine, specifically recalling carbonic maceration / beaujolais.  that bready note really strikes me as distinctive from other great hipas.  body is medium-light, oily-starchy-syrupy, medium-big carbonation, medium-coarseness, medium-light burn, creamy.  flavor is orange-guava with a balancing part of dank herbal-sap and some unripe lemon rind.  bit of demerara sugar.  all this leads into a substantial bitter aftertaste that lingers a moderate rate, zesty herbalness, combined with a brief touch of hard candy.  this is very good!"

I do not know if this is the best IPA I have ever drunk, but definitely in the top 5. at the moment of consumption a month has passed since canning with a delicate bookmark even, 2 weeks earlier it would probably have been cosmos."

Tree House Julius,3.7,"alcohol: 6.8% vol. 

canning date: 21.03.2018 

*what color is a tennis ball?* 

color: you, cloudy like carrot juice. 

foam: the strong side of beer. white, finely bubbled foam. high durability, wonderful lacing. mass of crinkles on the glass. full of points. 

smell: the aroma is heavenly! the power of tropical fruits mixed with citrus. 

it is impossible to list all the fruits that can be caught here, because with each sniff some new one appears. oranges, tangerines, limes compose and complement each other with mango, peaches and papaya. 
the fruity aroma profile is additionally supported by a wheat, sour base, a bit of resin and a flower. 
julius knows perfectly well how to charm the senses. 

taste: the taste already has a clear motif of citrus peels: bitter orange, lime peel and grapefruit. 

the dry profile is broken by sweet mango, papaya, peaches and pineapple. 

some herbal and resinous notes enhance the fullness of the taste. the beer is thick and oily. 

the bitterness has a moderate strength, is clearly marked, could be slightly shorter. 

high drinkability, but still two steps before sessionability. 

carbonation: moderate. 

summary: 

julius is a very good American pale ale. 

it was stuffed with American hops. it is smooth in reception, creamy on the tongue. at the same time, it is not bitter, but to an acceptable degree for my taste buds. 

the fruits that reign here are mostly citrus. 

the level of the beer is high, but unfortunately it does not come close to monkish brewing co., or the veil brewing co. 

I would even venture to say that some beers from cloudwater brew co., or verdant brewing co. beat Julius in the head. 

what I miss here is the juiciness, known from some beers from the above-mentioned breweries."

De la Senne Wadesda #9,3.6,"this just showed up at my local shop (imo, best beer store in bmore). says triple saison on label, whatever that means. side says amber craft beer, refermented in bottle. there wasn t even a price tag and i was surprised at the $7 cost when it was rung up. bb 23jun27. so, i ll assume it s 10 months old. pops hard and pours with a big, fluffy, strong head. i m surprised when i see the body, which i wouldn t describe as amber (but i do believe it s refermented in the bottle). color is dark golden, fairly clear with a light hazy (nothing close to what is considers hazy nowadays). looks great. then i smell it and i m taken for a loop  brett!!! i love brett and i smell it - earthy funky herbal potpourri with a swedish fish sweetness. i ll pause here before going on to flavor. after smelling it (and tasting it) i come over to rb and see that the description says it s a blend with cantillon. now, i m still pushing this brett in my sensory experience. i don t get too much of anything else that i would align with lambic. and i want to make to clear, my favorite style of beer is lambic blended with another belgian style beer. however, as i taste this i am taken for a spin. it is not the brettiness that i like. it s not the lambic blend that i love. it s actually a lot of goat-oil-like brettiness. that s not s complement. and as the beer warms up that goat oil comes through the nose. this is the fatal brett problem (and i m not sure what causes it). i love the appearance, i love that it s a lambic blend, and i want to love the beer. but, at the end of the day, it s a disappointment. i m the 10th rater (that s used to mean something in here) and the first us rater. so, i m not trying to be a hater and i want this to be better. i ll buy one more bottle and ate it to see what will happen."

Drake's IPA,3.7,"from jan 2008

i got this bottle from south bay drugs & liquors.

it pours from 12oz bottle a hazy gold with a good 1 finger head of foam and it has a lot of lacing.

the smell is very nice. lots of hops there but equally strong in the malt and together, it makes for a very bitter-seet nose. i like.

the taste is as if not more impressive than the smell. grapefruit and floral hop flavours in abundance but the malt sweetness somewhat takes the edge off the bitterness and it's *almost* a complete balance for this ipa....nah, there'd have to be a bigger malt profile here to do that. hops win flavour domination....by more than a nose. it has a good medium mouthfeel to it and the carbonation is fairly high. it finishes on the bitter side. i'd say this is more of an american ipa but it's reasonably near the ballpark. that said, this is quite a good ipa regardless and one i'd drink again without hesitation."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle from good spirits co. wine & beer, glasgow. beer served in 8 c, duvel glass. pours brown golden, medium head. aroma is like a tropical fruit pulp, mango, pear, molasses. taste is fruity, pine and herbal hops, earthy. medium bitterness, long lasting in the aftertaste."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"an ipa on the edge of the imperial ipa, since the abv level on the one hand could justify it with 7% 
on the meter, and on the other hand the intensity of the flavors is adequate to the ""imperialist"" style, with still 65 ebu well felt. 
our beauty was awarded a gold medal at the gabf in 2002. 
it has therefore been on the road for 15 years, and seems well calibrated to last. 
it is true that in the city of caterpillar we make solid machines 
caramel color a little red (and not soft ..), clear clarity. 
very fine bubbles, everywhere, slow rise. 
light brown foam, medium flakes, stable 2 mm. 
aromas of pine sap, cara malt, chestnut honey, hint of ""old times"" (from the belle époque
of old times, and not from the current one which is a real play on words, I agree ..). 
1st mouth supple at the start on the resin and hint of unrefined whisky. 
aftertaste the beautiful resinous bitterness. 
2nd the whole with lychee, resin, pineapple. 
very soft aftertaste, despite this good level of ebu. 
3rd with a beautiful sequence with brown tobacco. 
long, complex aftertaste. 
the length gives a lot of very elaborate nuances, great fusion resin / fruit / bitterness. 
oily legs, but sticky all the way up. 
slightly fruity yeast, beautiful line. 
correct alcohol, it helps the length to deepen the flavors.
finale from which we could have hoped a little more...
conclusion: after a very beautiful complex length, we hoped for a more flamboyant finale
in the land of caterpillars but we can trust this solid drakulesque machine (10/4/10/5/19)"

Drake's IPA,3.7,"355ml bottle from good spirits co. wine & beer, glasgow ( 3.80):

very nice stuff from drake s here & an unexpected taste from the beer given i was expected a tonne of hops before cracking the bottle open. the beer was definitely closer to an american pale ale of today than it was an ipa but it was first brewed 15 years ago & a lot has changed since then, still the beer was excellent with a lot of caramel flavours & a strong, malty taste in the early going. the nose in particular was a sweet one with only a few pine hops & floral notes backing them up, the balance was still maintained though & the beer went down very easily indeed; good stuff & one i wouldn t mind cracking open again at some point."

Drake's IPA,3.7,"355ml bottle @ chez sophie. pours a clear deep amber, medium off-white head. aroma of caramel malts, light fruit. taste is heavy on the caramel malts, with a fair sweetness offset by a piney resinous hop character. not my go-to ipa style, but its confident hop presence just about rescues it for me."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"from a 12 oz bottle into a chalice. pours gold with significant head and lace. aroma of hay, grains, pine, grapefruit. significant carbonation and mouthfeel. flavors of grains, pale malt, straw hops, grapefruit juice, pine, minerals, caramel malts. overall rich, flavorful and tasty. there s a nice balance between malt and pine hops and i could do a keg of this for sure!"

Drake's IPA,3.7,"ipa but strange somehow. poor appearance, little foam, no cloudiness only a light hazy scent. distinct citrus scent, even a bit herbal. in taste it's hop notes, citrus fruits and something that bothered me intrusive honey aftertaste, in addition it makes the impression as if it were about fat, so fat mouth reminded me of fish fat, or old oil in which fries were fried. the hop woman was quite big, but generally this ipa is disgusting for me. I do not recommend"

Drake's IPA,3.7,"initially almost perfect citrus aroma (with grapefruit dominance) - herbal, although the sweetness (bread, cookies, a bit of caramel) was also emphasized. unfortunately after a while there are slightly anise and honey notes, indicating oxidation. pity because it really promised to be not bad. 

color golden, deep, slightly hazy. to-white, finely bubbled foam, abundant and relatively durable, nicely sticking to the glass. 

taste is traditional English sweetness, well underpinning the approaching hop counter and alcohol. fruity-herbal bitterness, above average, to irritating and long. medium to round fullness, moderate carbonation and a slightly tart, slightly alcoholic finish. not bad beer, but bitterness and alcohol could be a bit less pronounced. more freshness would be useful for it."

tasting notes: dry hops, with a little kettle oil. barley malt out the ying yang! excellent mouthfeel: has 65 ibus, for the fellow hopheads out there"
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle pour. golden and hazy with generous head that dissipated fairly quickly. pine and citrus smells with some wheaty malt, but fairly weak in the nose. taste is well-balanced between hops and malt, along with some sweeter notes making their way in. lightly oily mouthfeel without being oppressive. very good for the price i paid for it ($7 for a 6-pack) but not sure i d go out of my way to pick it up again."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"aroma: roasty, grass, some spice or other unidentifiable. 
color is clear, sparkling, with no head or lacing.
taste is nice, loooong aftertaste that lingers. some interesting hoppiness.
solid ipa comparable to most"
Drake's IPA,3.7,"16oz draft. the best thing about this beer is the taste. very weak ln the aroma and color. flavors of bubblegum, lemongrass. easy drinking."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"seems to be an american ipa with some brit accents. appearance is good with a very long lasting, cream-colored head, some lace, and a clear amber color. aroma is mostly caramel malt with bit of hop. flavor is strongly hop bitter, carbonic tang up front, malt sweet in back with a very long hop bitter resin finish. palate is good.good drinking beer."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"poured into a shaker glass. bright amber with a cream colored head. aroma has some caramel malt, a nice dose of citrusy hops, and a touch of alcohol. flavor matches the aroma nicely with some biscuity malt notes up front and a nicely hopped finish. medium bodied with a slightly oily mouthfeel. overall a very nice ipa!"
Drake's IPA,3.7,"from a bottle, pours a hazy light orange. thin, sticky lace. heavy caramel malts to the nose. hops and spruce on the tongue. bready on the palate."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle. hazy deep copper with small off white head. aroma of citrus hops, light pine undertones, and some biscuit. medium/light body, moderate citrus pine hop bitterness, light malt backbone, and a dry citrus finish."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"as standard as standard gets with ipas. it's not poorly crafted and not stand-out in anyway. it's drinkable and has key elements of a traditional ipa; i just like something unique.

Drake's IPA,3.7,"aroma is slightly balanced to the malt, with floral and perfume scents from the hops. moderate low citrus as it warmed shows nicely. hazy orange with a full white head that patterns well down the glass. taste is more malt accented with biscuit predominating. slight orange. a spritzy carbonation on the end, and residual sugars leave a sweet finish. moderate bitterness is a little detracting from the beer."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"not a gusher, but a little overboard bubbly. smell and flavor are again malt dominated, even for an english style ipa. that said, it s a fairly well balanced beer, but it does nothing to justify being in the 98th percentile. fruity malt, with little in the way of bittering or floral hops...maybe a little past it s prime, but there is no date, so i ll never know.""
much better these days (2015) but i can t just forget the crap ones :)

Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle, thanks chris! prototypical west coast visuals ... orange-tinged amber, big rocky head. tart citric aroma stings the olfactory glands. but on the palate, this is more mellow ... there s definitely a mellower aspect of that california wet, mushy hoppiness. but it s also a bit more base ... a hint of cedar even. woody. (#5622, 8/15/2014)"
Drake's IPA,3.7,"drgreat aroma, dank and floral underlying pine, yep the flavor is the nose and well above average. tropical fruit with citrus and nice lingering pine hints in the finish. the bitterness lingers for a few seconds after the sip. true to style, west coast ipa. draft sample from the source."

Drake's IPA,3.7,i remember this beer being much better 2-3 years ago. it s not that bad just i guess another brew master must be at work at least for the ipa. denogginizer is solid if i get it fresh.

Drake's IPA,3.7,"drake's ipa is clearly the best ipa (for my palate) on the planet. i was first introduced to drake's when i moved to the bay area in 2000. i've had it on draft in my home kegarator ever since. i went through a minor scare when roger davis, the then brewmaster left lind brewing and subsequently when triple rock bought lind. but, fortunately, that resulted in roger being brought back into the fold. roger is simply an amazing brewer (and i'm in now way diminishing the current brewmaster, brian). in any event, i digress. the beer is a beautiful dark caramel color. the head, thick and foamy. the taste, bitter, piney and crisp. i travel a lot, and so have had the opportunity to try literally hundreds of other ipas across the country. a good close 2nd place is sierra nevada torpedo (which you can get country wide). but, i'm always excited to return home and draw a fresh, delicious, refreshing drake's ipa from my kegarator."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle 5 months old. pours clear dark yellow with great lace and lasting head. aroma is nice ripe lemon, biscuit, light almond. flavor is candied lemon, caramel, earthy strong bitterness. feel is still fairly lively, cooling, and medium bodied with a late bitter pucker. really nice. in a a way it is classic but also distinctly itself."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"pours a light amber color with an orange hue. aromar is of pine and spruce. taste is typical ipa, with bitterness and spice throughout. a forest tree flavor through the swallow. a light ipa in comparison with others from the style."
Drake's IPA,3.7,"wet hopped cask at mikkeller bar sf. poured a deep copper/golden. nose has fresh hops - citrus, pine and toffee. taste is quite thin and watery. pine and citrus still coming through ever so slightly. not getting much from the taste. watery palate lets it down a little ---rated via beer buddy for iphone"
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottled unk.
pours butter colored, a bit murky, solidly etched fine white surface. smells dank, with citrus, pine, resin, coconut, pineapple, biscuity malt, flavor is bitter, but still quite malty with a cracker like malt. hops are plenty juicy with some tropical character, some more pine, some orange peel and a little honey. medium bodied with moderately assertive carb and a wet finish. nice beer, would drink again for sure.

Drake's IPA,3.7,a 12 ounce bottle drunk in my hunting camp. a dark golden color on which floats a small puny head. a rather caramelized nose which shows interesting citrus perfumes and beautiful coniferous aromas. on the taste buds settle clear flavors of bitter fruits. a malted sugar which offers all the necessary respect. a very oily mouth and fine bubbles which explode with intelligence. a fresh and bitter finish which hangs on for long minutes. very happy to have come across a bottle which displays a splendid shape.
Drake's IPA,3.7,"bottle: slightly hazed amber center with some gold around the edges; big, chunky light-beige head that leaves very nice lacing behind. aroma contains a lightly ashy, piney, & herbal hop profile on top of a seemingly sticky sweet malt background with caramel & toffee. smells both bitter & sweet. taste is sticky toffee malt up front with a lighter hop presence on top of it. light citrus peel & pine notes, but mostly toffee, caramel, & light butterscotch malt notes. sweet, toasty bread finish. not bad, but not what i look for in an ipa - too large of a malt presence for such a modest hop bill."

dry and yet quite malty in the mouth with tight, champagne-like carbonation and tons of lactic acid mixing with light acetic acid and strong oak tones. a slick-to-malty texture with infinitely juicy stone fruits providing fuzzy, skin-like flavors and acids along with tart and fruity brett adding more complex fruits to the mix. sour and inviting, with a lip-smacking finish, good dryness and no alcohol or flaw whatsoever."

Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"crap. just realized i never rated this beer. i had it via bottle at farmhouse fest at hill farmstead. it was labeled differently back then. hazy and golden. looked gorgeous in the late summer sun. grapey, dog biscuit, crystal sweetness and a burst of lemon rind. mild funk really bright. enjoyed quite a bit and would have again."
Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"in short: a tart fruity blonde ale with a strong dirty farmhouse funk character. lovely. 

how: from a bottle at hill farmstead fofa 2013.

the look: cloudy dark blonde body topped by a small white head.

in long: a fun original aroma blending a strong musky/animal wild character with plenty of fresh light color fruits. in mouth the beer has a full body and a lively carbonation, a pleasant mouthfeel. taste follows through. a lot of fruits (peaches, apricots, others) well integrated in the farmhouse animal funk. some oak, some honey. assertive and refreshing tartness without being very sour per say. i am really digging this new brewery. i d buy cases and cases of sante adairius beers if i could but unfortunately their beers are as hard to find as a pop song about how tonight will be boring and unmemorable."

Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"from notes on 8/11/2013; poured from bottles by the sara crew at the hf fofa. 



straw-gold color, stubborn white head and lace. smells like soured pears! yeast-infected grain base, barrely with just the right amount of pucker, soured fruit comes forward again. closer to lambic than saison. 



drinking this proves (yet again) that sara knows exactly what they re doing in the realm of sours. bravo!"
Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"pours hazy pale yellow with a nice white cap, good retention and nice lacing. dry herbal brettiness, dust, floral - roses, bittersweet melon and peaches, citrusy, minty, peppery, hint of sweetness. moderate carbonation, light body - very nice texture and mouthfeel, slightly astringent and dry herbal-grassy finish. outstanding.. ex aequo favorite sara with bernice."
Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"bottle, hazy gold pour white head. white wine aroma, oaky, peaches (this is becoming a trend from this brewery), leather, earthy brett notes. flavor is a little maltier than the others we ve been having, crisp malt flavor, biscuity, with nice tart finish. palate is medium bodied with light carbonation. i presume this is an early bottling from this solera, seeing it doesn t seem completely soured yet. anyhow, quite good."
Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"pour is yellow with no head. a recurring theme with sara? aroma is really nice though with its fruity white wine feel. taste is really fruity (yellow fruits) and lightly tart. some oak character. carbonation level was close to perfect and the beer itself really drinkable. fun and really nice, one of my favorites from that night."
Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"bottle (750 ml). from cparles, thanks chris! hazy yellow/orange with a small white head and good lacing. aroma is mild (not weak, don t get me wrong) compare to the other sante adairius beers from our tasting, but it s delightful with white wine, tropical fruits, peaches, apricots, light tartness... superb! taste is gentle but a super wine barrel touch, light but effective malt backbone, tropical fruits, peaches, apricots, nice refreshing tartness and notes of oak. light body. low to moderate carbonation. winey mouthfeel. dry and acidic finish. superb barrel aged saison (sour). delicate, super drinkable and amazingly complex despite being somewhat mild. i loved it."

Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"bottle - thanks to mike for the share! pours hazy golden with a small white head that sticks around and laces well. aroma is light lemon, yeast, funk, perhaps oak, pretty simple overall. flavor is the same, not overwhelmingly complex, but medium tart, some funkiness, juicy with a touch of initial sweetness and a dry finish. light body and champagnelike carbonation makes this one very easy to drink; almost a cross between a berliner and a gueuze."

Sante Adairius Cask 200,4.5,"750ml bottle (edited for batch 1 and batch 2 comparison). both batches aroma are dominated by tart apricot and slight white wine grapes reminiscent of nelson hops. nice citrus twang with a kiss of honey sweetness and vanilla. batch 2 has more noticeable melon. pours a hazy peachy color with big soapy head. the foam has great retention and sticks around for a majority of the glass. sporadic lacing, small legs. taste is tart up front, with lots of fruit funk, some barrel, more of the white wine grape sweetness. light bitterness with a nice mineral quality. batch 2 has more apricot, mango and honeydew in the taste with medium tartness and light funk. both batches had good full, creamy bodies, but batch 1 finishes a lot drier than batch 2. overall a very amazing and complex saison with a good amount of tropical fruit in flavor and aroma."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"four-pack of bottles from bobkat (11% abv, not the 13% listed); bottled on 07.15.24.  nose is boozy and heavy with bourbon, maple syrup, caramel, touch whiskey lactone.  pour mid-brown with ruby highlights and a large, fizzy tan-brown head, only some lace.  taste lightly bitter with medium sweetness that collects to significantly more, but laced with maple syrup, caramel, and lots and lots of malt, really superb malt character here.  pleasant booziness, light nutmeg swashes on the edge, rich pumpernickel and browned bread crusts, medium-strong cola flavor, some cinnamon, vanilla, whiskey lactone.  alcohol is never too much (and never any burn), same can be said for the bitter and sweet, but it's richly malty with sticky lips.  full body, strong flavor, but melded and balanced.  zero pumpkin flavor, and no immediate identifiers of the underlying base beer (i.e., not immediately obvious if this is a brown ale or porter or what) - - just malt, maple, and bourbon.  it's easy to gush on honeymoon but this might be my favorite new beer of the year!  [2024.09.28: 4.6]"
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"(bottle) clear, dark cola-colored body with a large, light brown head that leaves large swaths of lacing on the glass. aroma is sweet with plenty of spices (nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, cardamom). medium-plus body; lively carbonation; sticky mouthfeel. flavor is same as the aroma: sweet and spiced. the spices taste real and authentic to me, and have enough presence and kick to nicely balance the sweetness.

pumpkin beers usually fall short for me, though there are some exceptions. this is one of those exceptions."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"pours a hazy mahogany color with a thin tan head.  aroma of cinnamon, maple syrup, vanilla, and some oak.  maple syrup sweetness with cinnamon, nutmeg, and some vanilla.  quite nice."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"12 ounce bottle. translucent mahogany brown color. creamy beige cap. aroma of toasted malt, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak and maple syrup. first sip brings notes of cinnamon, maple syrup, nutmeg, vanilla and oak. fairly smooth initially. warming alcohol arrives mid taste. mildly sweet, with cherry-like notes. finishes bittersweet with notes of toffee and bourbon. interesting."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"deep amber pour with a thin off white head and spots of lacing  . aroma of nutmeg, oak, vanilla, cherry, spicy bourbon, cinnamon and maple syrup  .. taste is of cherry, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, dry oak and spicy bourbon with sweet maple syrup  . balance of flavors is pretty good  . the pumpkin spice and regular bourbon barrel flavors kind of collide in this one   the oak and bourbon hold off the maple syrup pretty well  . finish has a lot of vanilla, cherry and dry oak with caramel and some lingering bourbon  . it s ok, abv is hidden well . comes off like a cocktail not a beer"
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"bottled 6/29/23, drunk 9/24/23.
clear amber. small, beige head quickly to edge.
nose is heavy pepper, heavy pumpkin and earth with tons of black licorice and light caramel. barrel aging does seem to have mellowed things, though there's no actual bourbon character. clean, spicy, malty, lightly alcoholic.
pretty good attenuation. bourbon barrel is lovely with nice syrup. pumpkin and earth with cinnamon and plentiful caramel-vanilla. this is shockingly decent. and somehow not viciously sweet or boozey in the mouth. seems like they've actually properly barreled it, mellowing out everything here including the spice."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"bottle at home little early in the season but could t wait. deep amber pour and some head. nose is pumpkin spice but also bourbon and hint of maple. tastes of bourbon barrel, vanilla, cherry, nutmeg and all spice. fairly easy to drink for abv."
Founders The Headless Gourdsman,4.6,"12 oz bottle dated 6/29/2023.  pours a clear brown with an off-white head.  big bourbon and spices aroma (nutmeg, clove, cardemom, cinnamon), with the maple as well.  flavor is a mix of bourbon, cinnamon, maple syrup, cocoa powder, nutmeg, clove.  very aggressive and boozy, and of course very sweet.  i don't generally go for ""pumpkin spiced"" beers, but with the over-the-top bourbon and other flavors, i'm more than willing to make an exception."
Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"can.  golden pour, huge fluffy head.  piney and grapefruit on the nose.  flavor similar, but as it warms, it mellows and soft melon and pineapple come out.  maybe just a tad sweet.  still, enjoyable."
Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,pours lightly hazy gold with a small lingering white head. it initially has a very piney aroma. as it warms the citrus comes out more. the flavor is intensely hoppy with pine and tropical fruit backed by a solid malt body. excellent.
Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,god it feels good to have a supper hoppy ipa in new england. i do like a hazy but the last week has burnt me out a bit. delicious beer that went down too quickly while dancing to ozomatli.

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"a light haze from the tiny, transparent particles floating around. the head is white, frothy with decent stay, and leaving small spots of soapy lacing. grassy hop aromas with a straw malt base and a touch of caramel, citrus notes. the taste shows a nice balance of grassiness with a blend of citrusy hops, over the maltiness. some nice mild bitterness and dryness occurs in the end. an easy-drinking double ipa with nicely balanced grassy hops and a tad citrus."

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"3/27/24 - albany, ny - coulson deli & market - 19.2 oz can. light golden pour, very slight bone colored that clings to the edge of the glass. toffee like aroma with some nutty accents. sweet flavor, toffee, biscotti wafers, touch of pecan-like nuttiness, molasses in the finish.  thick enough mouthfeel."
Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"slightly hazy deep copper and light bronze coloured body with a nice two to three centimetre tall off-white head that caps the beer nicely for a long time and covers up the zillions of small bubbles rising from the bottom and sides. aroma of grassy, herbal, floral hop notes and showing a dash of lemon and grapefruit zest, but the crispness is very strong in the nose. light to medium-bodied; strong grassy and herbal hops show at first with a lot of bitterness from the alpha acids of the hops, with a light touch of sweetness and fruit notes and a touch of alcohol at the end. aftertaste is very crisp, with the grassy and herbal notes dominate along with a nice apricot, lemony and grapefruity bite and enjoyable soft sweetness with a supportive, but pretty light malt backbone that's very grassy, too. overall, a nice, dry-ish, west coasty-ish ipa that doesn't quite reach imperial status at all, but is nice throughout, especially with the dry, grassy and herbal hops showing strong with a very mild sweetness just enough malts to support the bitter hops. good to sample, especially very fresh, and while i usually can't stand big cans like this, it just about works as an 8,2 per center, still strong, but i think i can get it down...once! i sampled this 19,2 ounce tall can, purchased from liqour outlet in boonton, new jersey on 26-november-2022, canned on 28-september-2022 and sampled at my house here in washington on 23-january-2023."

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"(a can from craft beer cellar): great malt base that is matched only by the humidity of its hops. the alcohol is incisive for a good part of the action. the greenery melts into the sugars, the body enjoys balancing everything and the bitterness evaporates quickly. a beast that changes for the better when breathing but which must be drunk fresh so as not to expose the muscular cereal base."
Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"can thnx to kyle ! enjoyed straight from the can to perserve the volotile aromas, so no info on the pour. the can is printed. looks very simpel, not very appealing. not much more than the basic info and some color. smell is intense, as it fills the room upon opening the can. the beer welcomes the drinker by a scent of complex, piny, mild stonefruit, and a grassy undertone. clean fermentation profile , maltyness hasnt got a big hand into the scent either' straight hopsauce ! taste is full on hoppy. medium bitterness for the style, perhaps even a bit on the lower end. medium-low mouthfeel. medium to medium high carbonation. hoppyness is grassy, pine, some stonefruit undertone. not much maltyness as a base. clean fermentation profile. might be world class if it had a bigger maltbase, for now its very good indeed, but i expected more of a top 50 in style , in a style i truly love."

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,moderately hazy ipa that is balanced with lots of flavor but goes more on the piney bitter side than sweet and juicy. but still some great tropical juicy hops in there.  citrus and tropical with dank piney and slight bitter. well balanced. definitely not a juice bomb. kind of a west coast meets east coast ipa. qualities of both.

was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. had not heard of fiddlehead until he sent it to me. excited to give it the old college try.

poured a medium yellow hazy color with three fingers of rocky white head. very light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. world-class layered lacing. almost perfect retention. (sight - 4.50)

smelled centennial, amarillo and mosaic for hops, and most likely citra as well. also getting orange blossom, orange creamscicle, tangerine, spoiled citrus fruit, tropical juice and some dankness. (smell - 4.00)

taste followed the nose for the most part, arguably better. got orange blossom, orange cream, tangerine rind, orange marmalade, mango, pineapple, pine, green leaves and some grapefruit. for hops mainly getting centennial and citra, but still mosaic and i think amarillo. (taste - 4.00)

light body. oily texture. lively carbonation. abrupt, citrusy finish. (feel - 4.25)

this was pretty good for a ne ipa. not necessarily my favorite style, but this was good. (overall - 4.00)

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"i ve been lucky enough to have many, many cans of this over the years. it s excellent. big hop aroma that melds with a malt body that s definitely sweeter than the average dipa. but rather than being cloying, the sweetness amplifies the hop aroma and makes one heck of a dipa."

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"can. completely clouded apricot hue with a frothy off-white cap that looks like it could stick around for hours. nice little aroma: pungent, it can be picked up pretty much as soon as the can opens. fresh grass, tangerine, hop resin extract, underscored with dank and a sugary pastry dough, oyster cracker maltiness. flavor adds some pithy citrus quality up front and an orange juice tang to the finish. layers and layers of hop flavor, the same melange of dank weed and grass and citrus juice, with just enough doughy and cotton candylike malt sugars to even things out before a flash of peppery hops and alcohol at the finish. body is really pleasant: creamy, pillow-soft and medium-light. definitely not as vibrantly hoppy as the best examples of the style, but balanced and dangerously crushable."

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"473ml can.

- amber color, tending towards red, with good carbonation.

- on the nose, a bomb of hops, going to play in the more fruity side but also quite resinous.

- the aromas continue in the taste, while there is a balance between the bitterness and the taste of the various hops.

- world-class dipa. the exoticism of the first sips gradually transforms into a resinous approach. sweet bitterness, beautiful balance, we ask for more.

Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,3.8,"yup, this brew nails it. fuck style, this is just a damned great beer. light coloured fruit cake and golden raisins find their way into the aroma and flavour only to be overpowered by a succulent hop barrage with both pine and resin achieving prominence while citrus takes a backseat. i couldn t even mention the malts, whatever is there is wonderful but just lets the hops shine. this beer is excellent!"

i am very surprised that i had to find this here, should've stumbled upon it a long time ago elsewhere.
clear yellow, large white head.
aroma of belgian yeast, lemongrass, coriander. quite simple, a bit sweet for a blond.
flavor is well balanced, mild, belgian yeasts, faint malty base, lots of yeast basd flavors, fruity and yellow fruity flavors and boxed off by a hoppy bitterness that is used to keep things together, not being a feature by itself.
a pretty nice belgian, very easy drinking, and although aroma hinted sweetness, it is quite dry and citrussy.

"Duvel 6,66% Blond",3.4,"I was pleasantly surprised by this Duvel, which is intended to celebrate the brewery's 150th anniversary. It's still incongruous to brew a reduced version of the Duvel for an anniversary. I was expecting a somewhat ordinary beer, and I must admit that the brewery has managed to preserve the character of the Duvel despite the 6.66%. And that's still putting myself forward. Note the use of 6 hops. On this side, I remain somewhat doubtful. I'm not sure that the 6 hops were necessary and that they all bring something. In the glass, we are on a clear golden blond with a fine effervescence and a 5 mm white foam. The nose inspires confidence. We find the character of the Duvel with cereals, coriander, alcohol, apple, pear and banana. In the mouth, we also find this character, which is notable for a titration of 6.66%. Nothing wild but a good little typically Belgian character. The alcohol and yeast are very important here. This is also the case in the tasting with a very effective alcohol and an appreciable presence in the mouth and length. We find the aromas present in the nose, without great variations while remaining pleasant. The tasting remains relatively homogeneous but pleasant and with temperament. If I consider an anniversary beer, I am somewhat disappointed, but this Duvel has real qualities."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"appearance: light, almost straw-like. very abundant white foam, small and medium-sized bubbles, quickly perforates and falls, slightly sticks to the glass.

aroma: a lot of American hops, in the form of ripe citrus, light ripe fruit, a little conifer, a bit of tropical. maltiness is also noticeable, in the form of sponge cake, fresh baked cake. a little spices typical of Belgians, the whole thing works well together.

taste: sweet, fruity in the mouth, a little citrus and resin, however, this sweetness present at the very beginning is quickly balanced. in the mouth at the beginning sweet, but very quickly countered by bitterness, which strongly flattens this fullness and completely covers the sweetness. beer after a while seems much more dry, bitter, with citrus, resinous, herbal bitterness enhanced by a large amount of alcohol. probably the best of the duvels I've had."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"For the Duvel Tripel Hop we have specified the three aroma hops citra, saaz hops and styrian golding. The nose tells us grapefruit and lemon in the foreground, a little nut and earth in the background. The coarse-pored foam is initially lush but soon disappears. The color is golden yellow and clear. 9.5% alcohol is a warning to be cautious. There is a slight yeast taste on the first sip, but this is immediately overshadowed by the hop bitterness and the alcohol taste. The beer is dry from start to finish. I'm already at the finish, the important part of the beer. Lemon and grapefruit are dominant here, I only taste the earth because I'm looking for it because of the saaz hops. The 48 IBU is understated in my opinion - I estimate the bitterness to be higher. The carbonation is good and makes the beer a little sweeter, but the strong bitterness prevents it from being drunk quickly. For me, the bitterness and alcohol are too strong for such a light beer. If you smash this grenade into your brain several times, you'll soon run out of it...

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"bottle from mattias's belgian beer run. lovely subtle aroma of eldeflower and melon. the citra doing its work. the appearnce is somewhat uninteresting. the taste is superb. the citra is doing exactly what it is supposed to and it is backed up by a thumping belgian abv that doesn't stick out too egreigously. a smashing ipa!....i had to return to this one because i'm feeling emotional about how good this beer is...so let's crack it up to a 4! (9/1/21).
----
bottle, same conditions. i was not so in love with this this time round. the sweetness of the hops and the bitterness is cloying in a strange way that i am not sure about. i can see how it could feel amazing but today it's not. a tough one. 4 to 3.8."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"a marvel of balance this duvel tripel hop citra belgian ipa. the power of a 9.5% triple perfectly balanced by the bitterness of the citra hops which erases the natural sweetness of the triple to make it a masterpiece of balance. when the belgian tradition mixes with the american tradition, it gives a top beer!"
Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"from bottle, best before 05/21. cloudy golden yellow body with a huge foamy long lasting head. grapefruit nose is very marked and dominates strongly over more subtle lemon, peach and banana undertones. nice carbonation gives crispiness and makes it very refreshing despite it high alcohol content. light bitterness and bready in mouth, reminds you it is a strong ale in the duvel tradition. a wonderful variation on the original duvel, that keeps all its qualities and adds some spark."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"cold on a hot evening
smell- weak, hoops, caramel, malt, but generally unspecidic and hard to tell.
foam- thin, hops, citrus, sourness. head is large white color, a bit yellow-ish.
appearance- beer s[ecific bottle cap, simple bottle in general. clear yellow, lemon color. high carbonation.
from- snifter
taste - hops, citrus, lemon, weak sourness. generally feels like hops mixed with some lemon juice, alcohol, however, is very well hidden here. do not know, this does not tickle any good feelings for me. there is grapefruit in back, gues that gives it sourness. not a fan of grapefruits, to be honest, so - nothing special."
Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"i have purchased this bottle, at one monoprix, at paris. drinking and tasting this beer, at bonfol, for my birthday, durin a rainy day. the body is yellow, grey and troubled, average carbonation, white foam. for me and it is a personal view, this beer is average but it is really boozy and sharp at the mouth with notes of a traditional duvel, dry malt, a bit sour, generous side of mango/peach, regular hop not so pronounced for this kind of hop."
Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"purvis cellars bottle (3-jun-20) peach floral aroma. cloudy amber colour, ok white head and smudge big suds lacing. sweet apricot spice flavour. tangy sweetish fruit finish and floral light herbal aftertaste."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"this is mega...

it's just a king of a beer, spine tingling stuff. had it before and was blown away, time for a review and it's absolutely stunning. so consistent.. 

the citra hop is so flavoursome, we all know it for it's floral and lemon and lime leanings but this beer has it dialled up to 11! fat, juicy, dangerous belgian beer without all the typical over the top sweetness that you can find all to often with beers in this category. its both refreshing and rejuvenating and this is all at 9.5% abv?!?! creamy, light, heavy, fresh, stunning beer."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"king of ipas to me, delightful slightly misty gold topped with a bright white snowy head. flavour packs a strong hoppy boozy punch, and grapefruit, citrus s all the while being reigned in with an easygoing mellow finish. the perfect ipa, sits right on top of the pyramid of ipas."
Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"light cloudy color. voluminous cap quickly dissipating until the persistent foamy thin layer. excellent effervescence. powerful aroma on the nose, more than the taste. marked aromas of lemon find an excellent balance with the other aromatic notes. good hops quite persistent in the adequately bitter finish. medium body supported by the 9.5 degrees that however flow easily as if they were 5. really a good product for my tastes."

Duvel Tripel Hop Citra,3.7,"duvel tripel hop citra was first brewed in 2012 and was the second hop variety in the six-part duvel tripel hop editions. it was chosen by the fans after a competition to be a permanent part of the duvel tripel hop range.
duvel tripel hop citra is a golden blond beer that produces a lot of white foam in a rocky shape with some coarse bubbles in between. it sticks strongly to the glass and remains very stable, after a while you still have a thick layer with some more coarse bubbles in between. you see a lot of co2 saturation with large bubbles.
the aroma:
sweet, hop bitter, apricot, citrus, bitter grapefruit, a floral touch, and a bit grassy from the hops.
the taste:
hop bitter, sweet, lots of citrus and grapefruit.
the mouthfeel:
full body with a light oily texture, tingling carbon dioxide.
the aftertaste:
still sweet and somewhat hoppy, citrus, grapefruit and a spicy coriander and pepper note. also a dry touch appears here for the first time.
the overall feeling:
a nice harmonious beer.
the verdict:
this citra duvel has surprised me again, the citra brought in with dry hopping does indeed bring a nice touch, not too strong but present enough. it is not too bitter and ends with an equally not too strong spicy touch. you can taste this perfectly.

Trappistes Rochefort Triple Extra,3.6,"There it is... I finally had it in my hand, this coveted Rochefort Triple Extra... and when I opened it, a fear came to me... and if this one was not up to the standard of its older sisters... it is because they have set the bar high... very high. So I pour it meticulously into my glass. A slightly veiled blond color appears. The effervescence is fine with a white foam that does not cover the entire surface. Already the nose reassures me with a good character and an interesting aromatic proposition, a subtle mix of cereals, coriander, apple, pear, orange peel with a touch of milk. And in the mouth, this triple reveals itself entirely... on a perfect malt/alcohol balance on the attack, between a veil of reassuring sweetness of the malt and the character of the alcohol. the second mouth presents an excellent depth with this tonic alcohol in retro, but also in the back of the mouth. the long finish sees the whole perfectly harmonize. no, i had not waited for nothing, and we find in this rochefort triple extra, all the fullness of the style with an aromatic proposition which knows moreover how to change habits. i will always keep a little weakness for the westmalle, but my greatest thanks to this great abbey for this gift."

De la Senne Bruxellensis,4.1,"bottle in private import. thank you phil boutin.
farm smells of horsehair and old barn denoting the intense use of bretts yeasts.
dust and ammonia are also on the program on a cereal background.
of a deep gold very close to amber with orange tones, the liquid is blurred, with an enormous foam resembling shaving cream, maintaining itself for long minutes.
on the palate, the bretts are dominant with all the characteristics listed in olfactory.
we note however a light tropical and citrus fruit flavor and a honeyed cereal background which persists until the finish helping to soften the sensation of ready.
quite dry, with a medium-light body, the texture rather soft and velvety, the liquid presents an active but not spicy carbonation. quite pleasant despite the dominant character of bretts.
rated as a brett beer and not as a belgian ale.

De la Senne Bruxellensis,4.1,"bought at prik&tik vercauteren in malderen/londerzeel on wednesday 29-01-2020. and tasted at home on 21-03-2020.
bruxellensis is a beer brewed by the brussels brewery de la senne and gets a second refermentation with brettanomyces yeast, the same one used by the lambic brewers in the zenne valley.
it has become a clear and amber-colored drink that produces an abundant amount of foam, it even slowly rises in the bottle neck after opening. it is thick-woolly in shape with some coarser bubbles in between. and sticks strongly to the glass wall. also a lot of co2 saturation with medium-sized bubbles. the fairly stable foam has after a while degenerated into a woolly layer of about 5 mm thick.
the aroma:
somewhat bret sour, slightly citrus and some mustiness.
the taste:
hop bitterness, banana and a touch of pepper. the mouthfeel:
full body, somewhat bitter dry, full-bodied texture and a tingling carbon dioxide.
the aftertaste:
flows out for a very long time, especially the bitterness comes up here, slightly dry and a hint of pepper. the bitterness takes over the mustiness here.
the overall feeling:
a harmonious beer.
the verdict:
it has not become a beer like gueuze. in fact there is not even much sourness to be found here, also little taste and everywhere a bit of that mustiness. at the end you notice a bit more bitterness and the mustiness fades into the background. I think the hops have counteracted the brett (or vice versa) a bit.

funky aroma - sort of apa base... pale malt, slight caramel, pine hops, but serious horsey, sweaty brett going on!
medium weight, brett obviously adds is own dryness and tannin quality to the mix that lingers.

contrary to what jybi writes, acid is not the enemy of taste! many chefs also praise lambics or gueuzes and many terroirs of great wines give a lot of acidity. the use of citrus fruits is also very trendy.

but here the acidity is moderate and controlled and you don't have to love acid to like this beer. fans of saisons, for example, will be put off by this beer!"

drunk from the bottle (bottled 16-07.2016/bbe 16.07.2018) in 2020-03. brasserie de la senne had brewed this heavily hopped ale with brettanomyces. but due to its age, the brettanomyces have changed this ale significantly. There is no more acidity here and the hop bitterness has become significantly weaker. Instead, this bronze-colored ale has a similar champagne yeast note with a farmhouse style. Really classy and a great summer beer. 9/4/8/4/11"

Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"The love beer appears in the wheat glass more yellow than orange, very cloudy and with a generous amount of foam. The nose detects mild yeast, green apples and also a little banana, which is pleasantly fresh and slightly sour. In addition, citrus and herbal hop notes can be detected, which are indeed reminiscent of a good Franconian cellar beer. The start is finely tangy with a pronounced but mild sourness and quite noticeable yeast. Mild notes of unripe fruit and aromatic hops give the impression that this is not your average wheat beer. A pleasingly low carbonation gives the full-bodied love beer a nice sweetness. The lemony-herbal hops do not let the beer lover down in the finish either. A slightly bitter, grassy aftertaste also suits it well. A pleasantly atypical wheat beer that is surprisingly hoppy and pleasantly sour and does without the usual banana sweetness. Extremely refreshing, highly aromatic and definitely worth trying!"

Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"A decent amount of yeast wafting through the glass. But this doesn't play a particularly big role in terms of taste. Fruity notes dominate here: grapefruit, orange, lemon peel, a little dark berries. Also a tiny hint of sparkling wine. Clearly hoppy and bitter, more than is usually the case with a Bavarian wheat beer. A smooth consistency is combined with a pleasant effervescence - it has a certain substance and is still light and sweet. Overall, the beer is not 100% well-rounded, but interesting and definitely an enrichment for Schneider's range.

Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"bottle (mar 3, 2022 bottling). head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. body is dark yellow. aroma is lightly malty (toasted/scorched grain/seeds), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with a strong note of camphor/medicine, lighter notes of orange and clove. flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. light to medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

the aroma doesn't offer much in terms of the typical weissbier esters, it's really quite medicinal/phenolic. in the mouth, it's quite sour and bitter, acrid and biting. light and watery too. not good at all."
Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"a beer with a light straw color, surprisingly transparent and clear, which makes it look like a kristallweizen. the foam is abundant, fine, white, compact and durable, and slowly reduces to an even layer.
aroma medium-intense, pleasantly phenolic. the spicy notes of clove, a little yeast and bubble gum are most pronounced. in the background light banana esters.
the flavor profile of this beer is built on a light wheat sweetness, a yeasty aftertaste enriched with wild boar and a low but perceptibly marked herbal bitterness providing a nice balance and a more dry finish. in this respect it is probably one of the drier wheats I have had the opportunity to drink.
high carbonation but not excessive at a level appropriate for the style. the overall impression is a pleasantly light, non-clumsy wheat that gives a welcome feeling of refreshment."
Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"50cl bottle. a hazy dark golden beer with a big beige head. aroma of clove, wheat malt, spices. taste of spicy wheat malt, lot of clove, yeast. refreshing!"
Schneider LaBrassBanda Love Beer,3.4,"schneider weisse and labrassbanda ... a top white beer brewery and a top brass band. personally speaking: I love both! and I think the design of the label is more than successful. plus the white crown cap with a red heart. really great! but let's wait and see what this wheat beer can really do.

visually very cloudy and a mix of yellow-orange, ochre and amber. the white, fine-pored head of foam looks almost creamy and stable and lasts very well. the scent is very typical, strong yeasty, slightly musty and on the fruity side a little muted citrus-like. there is certainly no trace of the classic banana here. the first sip is pleasantly tangy, seems very fresh and convinces with a light malt component and a crisp citrus aroma. On the palate, the aroma is just as fresh with a pleasant, light body. Unfortunately, I can't quite identify the elderflower that is ""advertised"" on the label. However, I can identify gooseberry, not quite ripe grapes and delicate citrus fruits such as sour orange or mandarin. In the background, there is a surprisingly noticeable grassy to herbal hop note and hop bitterness, which fits in well. Personally, I like the fact that the usual and overdone banana note is absent. On the other hand, I prefer duller, more malty white beers. The very fresh, tangy, sour and delicately bitter taste may be a little too strong for some people, but it still seems well-thought-out and harmonious. In terms of mouthfeel and sweetness, I think it's pretty good. It seems very fresh and not too heavy, especially in the hot season. And I think that's exactly what this beer is intended to be. In the aftertaste, the soft yeast character settles nicely in the mouth and allows the fruity aromas to fade away slowly. After a while, a slightly dry, hay-like to herbal hop aroma sets in, which lasts for a very long time.
Conclusion: Even though I prefer richer, heavier wheat beers, I have to say that this ""love beer"" is a pretty good, refreshing, fruity-sour summer wheat beer that you'll enjoy drinking at festivals, on warm summer evenings, or at a hot Labrassbanda concert."

Trillium Fort Point Pale Ale,3.7,"pours a hazy peach coloration with a small, fizzy head. smell is initially quite lovely, with hoppy, juicy tropical/citrus fruit notes of mango and passion fruit with a hint of pineapple and tangerine, but takes on a light cat piss note as it sits. taste is very bright and hoppy, dominated sweet, juicy tropical fruit notes of mango, passion fruit and pineapple and with zesty citrus notes of grapefruit and tangerine. there's a light dankness and a hint of pine to this as well, almost no malt presence detectable though. finishes with a light bitterness and very mild hop burn. soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. this is the quintessential ne style pale ale and i would say that it has an amazing juicy hoppiness, mouthfeel and depth of flavour for a pale ale, but is this even a pale ale at 6.6% abv? nonetheless, it's still an excellent beer at a relatively low abv. the balance of sweet tropical fruit, zesty citrus fruit and dankness/pine really is outstanding here."

bottle from cotteridge wines; cloudy orange pour with soapy white head, floral hop aroma, taste has passion fruit slightly grassy bitter and delightful."
The Kernel India Pale Ale Galaxy,3.4,"bottle from bacchanalia, cambridge. 7.2%. 330ml bottle. bottle expired in sept 2012, so might not be as fresh as it should. transparent, slightly hazy, with a nice golden colour. pours fair sized white head, which persists well. light carbonation. aroma - hits you straight in the nose with a wall of lovely and intensely fruity & floral hops and candyish, sugary sweets & caramel. very fruity; tropical (pineapple), sweet, juicy & citrus, and also very floral and nectary (what with the sweetness). lots of oily hops, which are quite spicy and musky, with some grassiness too. a distinctly kernel aroma of sweet fruit. i can only imagine how good this would have smelled when fresh. taste - bitter, which was a bit of a surprise, given the aroma. all the other big, fruity pale ales that i ve tried from kernel haven t been overly bitter and are sometimes a bit too sickly. a lot of bitterness upfront, stuck to the tongue throughout. but there are a lot of fruit flavours in there to distract you from this: tropical fruit juice, pineapple, pink grapefruit, grape, floral. pine and some spicy & grassyness too. lots of hop oils to coat the tongue. malt is caramellish. finish is lingering bitterness, with fruit & hop flavours. body is medium and oily. a lovely, intensely fruity ipa, that really packs a punch and does a good job of showing what this hop can do, but though it s nice to have some refreshing bitterness to such a big, fruity beer, this is a bit too bitter for my tastes."
The Kernel India Pale Ale Galaxy,3.4,tap at de molen 2011... hazy amber ... big hit spicy hop nose .... juicy oily hop ... too bitter for me ... oily hop ... huge citrus ... too much for me
The Kernel India Pale Ale Galaxy,3.4,"aroma is a bit sweet and syrupy with some orange coming through. flavour is quite bitter with some bittersweet orange oil coming through strongly. the balance on this one is more in the direction of oily, bittersweet fruitiness and less so on the lighter tropical and citrusy fruit flavours."
The Kernel India Pale Ale Galaxy,3.4,"bottle (330ml):

strong pine aroma with touches of grapefruit in there and a whole lot of hops. there is some citrus and a tonne of bitterness and some more grapefruit notes right at the end that is pretty crisp.


hazy orange colour with touches of amber and a foamy but thin, white head that settles to a thin and patchy lacing after about 2 or 3 min.


strong pine hops and a lot of grapefruit, exactly what i would expect from a kernel ipa. there is huge amount of grapefruit with a touch of citrus, orange and lemon. this one is a standard but fairly nice tasting ipa with great bitter notes and good strength.


light medium bodied with tonnes of bitterness and light carbonation. it s a smooth beer and has bitter, wet finish that has a lingering grapefruit taste that stays for a while.



just what i was expecting from this one really; a solid, big hitting ipa with huge amount of pine and bitterness with enough background flavours to make it work."

wonderful hop and pine smells assault the nose along with citrus fruit, predominately grapefruit. 

the taste is all hops, citrus fruit largely grapefruit as per the nose, maybe a sweeter fruit flavour in the background possibly apricot and also a sweet carmel undercurrent, but very subtle and understated. 

great mouthfeel this beer massages the throat, medium bodied with minimal carbonation leading to a bitter-sweet semi-dry aftertaste."

earlier rating: 11/2/2010 total score: 4.3
aroma is dominated by the smell of whisky from the barrel, which is unfortunate because it tends to drown out the good smoky and molasses stout aroma. there is a nice undertone of charred wood, though. it pours a nice oily opaque sable with a rather thick and fine-bubbled, if not too persistent, chocolaty tan head. flavor has tones of molasses, quality roast coffee, unsweet chocolate and licorice, with a strong and almost overwhelming overtone of whisky - good whisky, but that tone could be a wee bit more subtle. texture is silky smooth with a decent fizz and a nice bite from the whisky."

Hoppin' Frog Barrel Aged BORIS The Crusher,4.2,"hoppin' frog's flagship stout, aged on heaven hill barrels, the well-known bourbon from tennessee.  bottle from etre gourmet.  medium sized, mousy, mocha-beige, opening and thinning head on a pitch black beer.  strong nose of 'fondant' chocolate, vanilla-scenting oak wood, toffee, damp wool blanket, quite obvious bourbon, ground hazelnuts, tawny port, bayleaf, gravy, soy sauce, mocha ice cream, fig compote, blood, fresh thyme, paprika powder, candied cherries.  sweet onset, candied dates and figs mingled with dried blueberries, softishly carbonated with a thick, oily to even syrupy body; intense, layered black-chocolatey and hard-caramelly malts with a toasted walnut bitterness and eventually quite outspoken coffeeish roastedness to it, even if the sweeter, more chocolatey-nutty aspect remains firmly in control, as in many present-day american style imperial stouts.  this thick and mouth-filling black malt 'bed' handles the pronounced bourbon aspect perfectly, absorbing much of its sheer booziness and translating it into a pleasant, chest-warming glow - while releasing all the vanilla, oaky and whisky-like flavours associated with it.  the bourbon does add a thyme- and pepper-like spiciness to the finish, while the wood remains elegantly tannic but clean.  classic american style barreled stout, ticking all the boxes of what one tends to expect from a bottle like this - and classic (or indeed, unsurprising) as it may be, this kind of beers still hit a sweet spot in me.  lovely, but pricey at least here in belgium."

Hoppin' Frog Barrel Aged BORIS The Crusher,4.2,"bomber, poured into a snifter at ~40 degrees f.

appearance: pours your standard stout black, and forms almost no head (we re talking quarter-finger or less here) of a dark brown foam that vanishes swiftly and leaves only an infintesimally small ring in its wake.

smell: warm, boozy, oaky, vanilla-caramel bourbon wafts out of the glass, atop a cloud of blackened malt and sweet molasses.

taste: a shot of straight bourbon, like a basil hayden grade, without the alcohol burn and with a bite of a stick of black licorice or perhaps some freshly ground star anise - that s more or less the flavor profile here. there are hints of molasses, caramel, plum, and vanilla extract, especially in the finish and aftertaste, but for the most part, this is a bourbon and anise ride. what abv may be present is well hidden, lending no heat to the beer.

mouthfeel: somewhat thin for a stout, on the very heavy side of medium-bodied, or the lightest side of full-bodied.

overall: a solid ba stout, up there with thirsty dog as far as concealing the abv while bringing the flavors through is concerned. it s a bit less complex than a ba siberian night, but there is something to be said for a well-executed simplicity."

Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"Served in a Spiegelau IPA. 

Appearance: Amber with some orange sparkles, cloudy as usual for the style. White foam crown with medium-low retention, with compact and open bubbles. 

Aroma: An intense hit of tropical fruits, predominating notes of mango and ripe pineapple, blueberries characteristic of Mosaic hops, sweet orange, melon, papaya, passion fruit, tangerine, slightly white grape juice, something very faintly herbal, like freshly cut grass and pine. Wow! 

Taste: Again, notes of sweet tropical fruits explode; blueberries, mango and ripe pineapple, passion fruit, melon, papaya, sweet orange, tangerine, some white grape juice, slightly herbal like freshly cut grass and very slightly pine, sweetness of the malts with some very discreet honey notes, just to enhance the hops. The aftertaste is a medium-low bitterness, with a long lingering fruity flavor that continues, continues, continues and continues to stick to the palate. 

Sensation: Medium-light body, medium-low carbonation. 

Summary: World-class double IPA."

Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"poured from a 16 oz can dated 10/31/2016. 
aroma is full of over ripe tropical fruit, pineapple, and resin with some light citrus notes. hints of grain and wheat along with a bit of alcohol. 
pours a somewhat hazy golden orange with a medium sized, moderately thick, white head that recedes steadily to the edges where it lingers for a bit. no lacing and medium small legs. 
flavor is somewhat sweet with light grain notes and a bit of wheat. medium high bitterness with some light alcohol notes. moderate hop notes with overripe stone fruit, mango and pineapple. some light citrus notes and some resin. 
mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
overall, a nice dipa. nice hop profile with a malt presence that adds sweetness but doesn t get in the way of the hops. bitterness is present, but its not over the top."

Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"750 ml bottle shared by ebone1988. the pour is a turbid golden orange with a thinner white head and a little bit of lace left behind. the aroma is pretty good. lots of hops. there is a good balance of citra and mosaic. it s good. there is a great hop and a nice smooth juiciness. the flavor is bring and juicy. there is a hop balance that s a little strange but well balanced. i love how there is no malt in the trillium beers. the mouth feel is a little heavier than i d like with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly sweet hoppiness. it s really interestingly complex. this is not the worst of the beers, but it s definitely not their best."

Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"pours a medium golden with a small white head that leaves good lacing. nose is of (ripe) tropical fruits and alcohol. taste is more juicy fruits and moderately bitter. almost no alcohol detected here. moderate body and carbonation, juicy mouthfeel. exactly my kind of dipa. great!"
Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"my bottom line:

grapefruit pith and various citrus fruit are emboldened by dank hop undercurrents, leading to coniferous bitterness and much enjoyment for the hophead.



further personal perceptions:

-a veil of foam tops the misty blond.

-lightly honeyed cereals build a smooth structure for all the hops to play on.

-the flavor profile and finish aren t excessive; just immensely flavorful while leaving room for drinkability.

-this is a great double ipa every way you look at it.

Trillium Upper Case,4.1,"draught at publick house, for trillium 2nd anniv., 3/23/15
massively fluffy white head is well-retained and tops a moderately hazy, very sunny golden body.
from the first sniff, you know. it s going to be a good one. incredibly clean, bright, hop notes portray all sorts of tropical fruits. suffice to say we ve all smelled a delightful tropical fruit-hopped dipa and this is one of the best ones. no yeast, vitamin, dough, dishwater, blanding; none of that. soft, but perceptible honeyed malts sit in the background giving support but certainly adding nothing more than needed. alcohol nowhere to be found. aroma strength is very high.
the flavor delivers and then some. kind of surprised by the ratings, seems like almost everyone loves a solid dipa. not that the ratings are low here; far from it, but i couldn t find much to fault this thing for. wonderfully effervescent carbonation spreads the delicious hop flavors about, while just a touch of alcohol (welcome here) and bitterness begin to build. the fluffy, moderately sweet pilsner malts balance nearly perfectly here and the whole thing glides down the throat leaving you wondering how you just drank a 9% abv double ipa. it sucks to nitpick, but i guess that s what rating beers is about and i guess, ultimately, this one s just a little on the sweet/sugary side. hard to fault it much for that, as i d much rather brewers err on the side of a bit too much balancing malt instead of the reverse leaving a mouthful of astringent, dry, burning resin.
other than that, what else is not to love here? not quite as explosively juicy and overwhelmingly lush as pliny the younger, but it makes you think along those lines, which is always impressive. if trillium is doing this on their 2nd anniversary, they ve got a very bright future ahead."

Cloudwater The Realest,3.8,"from goblet beer stora rijeka.
when an ipa has 10% alcohol, you expect it to be a bomb in every respect, and in this case it really is!
the aroma is a mixture of orange, tangerine and lemon. the body is dense and slightly sharp.
the taste is like the aroma and it is extremely intense.
the mountain is mild and mostly of the foot type.
the alcohol is well incorporated, but still in the end it takes that ten percent to warm it up.
all in all, it's well done, only I would share that beer with someone because it's too sweet and half is enough for me...just for the sake of it.  :)"

canning date: 12.06.2019

colour: the colour of a ripe orange, completely cloudy

smell: nice, quite strong aroma, but it had neither diversity nor intensity.

classic combination of citrus peels and sweet mango with a touch of papaya.
some milky notes in the background and a distinctly sweet base.

taste: the taste is a combination of resinous, tropical and exotic notes.
initial coniferous, larch-pine character smoothly changes into a more fruity one.
green grapefruit, orange, and papaya and mango in the background.
mild bitterness, slightly scratching in the throat. medium-sized texture. quite ok drinkability .

saturation: low/medium.

Trillium Big Bird,3.9,"canned 6/29/17, shared 7/7/17 and another can drunk 10 days later.
strong soupiness to it, with a medium-small, white head showing moderate retention. typical bronze-amber-maize color of the street series.
juicy and lush in the nose with tangy lime, dense papaya and guava and tons of ""sweet"" tangerine. i think the general consensus is that this is vic s secret and it makes sense, given all of the soft, highly juicy, round tropical and tangerine fruit notes. with eight days on the first can i tried, it s still got a good greenness to it that adds a strong citric bitterness (strong lime and lemon) but it s nonetheless quite enjoyable.
 the texture is as one would expect for the street series and that bump from 7.2% to 8.5% isn t felt tremendously. good backing of supple malts that are well-attenuated with rich honey and light biscuit character. tight carbonation concentrates the intense hop character and there s an explosion of fruit and moderate bitterness on the finish.
the can drunk at about three weeks old proved even better, showing none of the slightly rough edges of the younger and no less intense, fresh, juicy hoppiness. really wish i d saved more of these things to try in the three to four week range as this was superb. i m looking forward to batch 2 already. much less intensely hop soup-like and less ""thick"" than headroom."

pours a deep amber with a small but persistent head of foam.

the nose is of whiskey, vanilla, lightly boozy, heavily malty.

the taste has the not so subtle whiskey, vanilla, mild malty sweetness, more whiskey though it doesn't reach a super boozy state.

pretty light bodied for a brew of the abv. gets thin at times.

so, this was aged for me...i didn't ask for that. i would have preferred finding it fresh and then making my own decision whether to cellar it or not.
as is, it's not too shabby."

Rogue Dead 'N' Dead,3.8,"weird how bourbon barrels affect dead guy, bringing out a surprisingly prominent sweet apple fruitiness normally kept in check by the moderate hopping. here the apples flourishe, mixing with cherry, vanilla and caramel notes to create a cola-like undercurrent, accentuated by the oak and whisky dominating the finish. the booze comes on strong--the bottle says 8.2%, unlike rb's description--but never grows too warm. booze and pacman esters on the nose, and the pour comes out okay, a clear copper-gold with a modest head and slight lacing. slight heat on the palate, but also creamy and sippable. much prefer regular dead guy, but 'n' dead is worth a pint or two."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"2020 bottle. finally getting to try this long-time want! pours dark brown, near black, with a brown head that fades into splotchy lacing. oily in the glass just like the other hunah's. nose was oak, apple brandy, with hints of chocolate and vanilla. taste follows with present barrel notes providing warmth but no heat. the vanilla and cocoa are prominent, but the chili peppers were barely noticeable. a dry note from the cocoa hits mid-palate with a touch of cinnamon before the apple brandy barrel takes over in the finish. as much as i wanted to rant and rave about this one, it might be my least favorite of the hunah variants that i have tried. still fun to try and glad i did!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"new 2020 version. strong cinnamon and milk chocolate in the aroma with apple pie, not as boozy as i expected. dark brown body and head. apple pie taste, brings out vanilla, some welcome oak barrel at the end to break up the sweetness. not super thick and mouth coating, but that works well with these flavors."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle sample (massive thanks to tad & co 14/04/2017) - black pour with small tan head. aroma and taste is sweet malty with notes of chocolate, caramel, treacle, some chili spice, apple brandy wooden accents coming in, rather old and restrained now, but sure would of been immense in its heyday."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"32 oz. screw-top growler graciously shared by dave. originally reviewed 6/29/2012.

pours an incredibly flat inky black. glass-staining, as always. viscous, but no head. bummer. growler, maybe?

nose is brandy, booze, and, well, standard hunahpu aromas. chilies and chocolate. and more booze. the brandy aroma is a little on the sickly sweet side, though. really detracts, i think.

tastes awfully sweet at the start. brandy comes through, but it isn t an imposing flavor, except for the sweetness. chocolate and chilies are still pretty potent in this treatment. thick and sweet and syrupy, though. every bit of sugar is amplified by the brandy.

thick and boozy. still has the wonderful viscosity of hunahpu, though, but it tastes every bit of 11.5% and then some. the sugar doesn t help.

not an impressive treatment. it s still a fascinating combination of flavors, but not something that improves upon the original beer."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,sweet brandy alcohol heat that adds amazing complexity. subtle oak and vanilla blending in with the vinous dark fruit notes. chewy viscous body with lots of silky chocolate maltiness that is balanced out by the vinous apple brandy barrel notes. slightly earthy oak that is very vinous with hints of dark fruit and vanilla balancing out the chilli and roasted malt perfectly.
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"as good as it gets for barrel-aging synergizing with the base flavors. rich spiciness and heat from the barrel, chocolatey and fudgy, that signature ccb stout mouthfeel, jesus christ this beer is amazing. i of course gave away one bottle and traded the other. oh well."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle 2/84 at tasting. black pour with no head. aroma is quite mellow compared to the other huna (tasted side by side with 2010 regular version), faint spirit notes, nothing identifiable as apple brandy however, just a more integrated, mellow spiciness, cocoa, cinnamon notes. taste is balanced, lots of cocoa, light spirit flavors, spicy finish, light alcohol warmth. nice stout."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle #2 of 84 shared at the 2014 tasting in the cellar of moeder lambic saint-gilles. pours near black with no head. aroma is fairly light with the vegy chilli , roast, dark chocolate and caramel. flavor is moderate to heavy sweet and bitter. the palate as well is somewhat subdued, maybe from the age. it s lovely, but subtle. the apple brandy aspects come out lightly but nothing much. full bodied with soft carbonation. great, but so subtle compared to the fresh normal huna drunk side by side."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"sampled from a 0.75l bottle @ top hops (ba) bottle share. damn this is black. doubt the blackness-scale has anything blacker than this and it has a small quickly sidesticking really really deep dark brown top. lovely nose with chocolate, apples, vanilla, wood, and it s actually so deep and intense that it s a little scary. yeah i said it, i m a little scared. it s super smooth in the mouth! thick, chewy and almost syrupy oily with a soft really prickling and stingy carbonation. it has a pure chocolaty liquefied roasty flavor. oh my. there is also a soft sharpness in the finish here. only subtle nuances of apple, wood, vanilla, raspberries and dark cocoa powder. one of the best i ve had in a long time (and i have recently had some pretty incredible stuff). huge thanks josh! the things i would do to this bottle if i could just get it for myself.. 15.06.2013"

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"original review (2012-07-16): gloops from the bottle as any zhukov-based brew should. tremendous roast in the nose with brandy and caramely notes. lots of complexity here, though i wish it were more pungent. 



taste is marvelously complex with brandy, booze, vanilla, spice, and plenty more that end up dancing atop the delicious stout base. chiles are mild, where they belong. the trademark hunahpu s chocolate, vanilla, and chile aftertaste gets a boost from the brandy as it tickles the back of my throat upon swallowing. ultra-viscous body, as expected, and just amazing. 



ranks among the best stouts i ve tasted. i could drink the whole growler!"

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"backlogged. small sample at capones during the 1st cc event in 2011. this was the first time they sent their beers to our area. poured deep black with medium sized mocha colored head. aromas were rich chocolate, vanilla, apple brandy, wood, cinnamon, and light pepper. flavor was more layered with soft wood, brandy booze, sweet malt, spices, and cocoa. medium to fuller bodied with light to med carbonation. barely any booze present. this was another gem at an awesome cc event before they over-extended themselves."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"22nd may 2011
bottle 57/84. opaque black beer, thick dark brown head that dies away quickly. softish semi dry palate. when cold it s all about the soft creamy chocolate with dashes of coffee and molasses. as it warms up other  flavours appear - wood and vanilla sweetness. the apple brandy is quite subtle but provides a fruity sour undertone. gets a little stronger towards the finish and is in balance with the chocolate and coffee. this is a lovely beer but i m surprised how high in the top 50 it is."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"poured from a 32 oz. growler into a snifter.

like the regular hunahpu s, the apple brandy barrel aged hunahpu s pours a viscous dark black chocolate color with a barely noticeable tan head around the ring of the glass.

the aroma is full, complex, and somehow elevated beyond the greatness the original hunahpu s achieves.  the brandy is noticeable and seems to gently overlay the other aromas, which are consistent with the regular hunahpu s: dark chocolate, a bit of espresso, vanilla, with a bit of pepper and a slightly fruity apple presence.

each sip is nearly perfect.  the dark chocolate fudge, roasted malt, and creamy espresso notes all blend amazingly well with a brandy flavor.  the middle of the sip contains the zenith of its complexity, with the apple coming through, mixing with oak and vanilla from the barrel, and a bit of residual chocolate flavor.  the end of the sip wraps the treat up nicely, leaving a nice brandy flavor in my mouth.

the brandy mellows out the sticky sweetness that the base beer contains, and the barrel definitely lightens up the carbonation a little bit as well.  it is creamy and smooth, with the brandy cutting through the thickness of hunahpu s as well.  this beer really just has the perfect body, carbonation, and smoothness that i am looking for.

after tasting hunahpu s for the first time i did not think there was any way to improve on it, but after having the whiskey and the brandy, i have changed my opinion.  this is such an incredible beer."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"32oz growler courtesy of lopo87. thanks! small 3 oz pour.

a: thick as motor oil. no head. legs on the glass like the lamp from a christmas story.

n: intense caramel, cotton candy, brown sugar, coffee, fudge. this is mostly sugar, though, hence the score.

t: good god. diabetes. cinnamon, chocolate, coffee, a little bit of soy sauce. a very slight pepper. lots of dark fruits. alcohol is well hidden. pretty much the epitome of throw everything into the kettle. 

m: heaviest beer i ve ever tried. a little bit of carbonation. expands and contracts all over my palate.

o: there s almost no apple brandy so deducting some points there. honestly, this is amazing, and then it s way too much. i compared it to the way nibbler must feel in futurama as well as making the mitch hedberg joke that it s like pancakes: when it starts, it s amazing, by the time you re done, you re sick of  em."

pours as only a ccb imperial stout can. thick as motor oil but silky smooth capped by a rich, dense, red-clay colored head that stains the hell out my hunahpu s snifter and leaves beautiful rings of lace. aroma is nothing short of divine with all that is great about the base beer...dense dark chocolate, heavy roast, a touch of toasted cedar, burnt cinnamon, smoked chilis, molasses, and espresso backed by elegant notes of wet oak, baked cinnamon apples, and sweet, boozy brandy that really pops as it warms in the glass. flavor is a near out-of-body experience with the oak, sweet brandy, and subtle apple notes complimenting and adding a level of complexity to the heavy dark chocolate fudge, espresso, vanilla, cinnamon, and smoked notes of the base hunahpu s but allowing the rich toasted cedar and mild chili spice to still shine on the back end. palate is sheer perfection as well with the bold, imposingly thick, yet smooth as silky mouthfeel i ve come to love in the base hunahpu s with a long, lingering finish of subtle chili spice, dark chocolate, and sweet brandy. overall, this may be the single best beer i ve ever tasted. it s an absolute marvel and a testament to barrel aging. wow."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"growler sent from an awesome regular trading partner, thanks dave! pours a pitch black in color with a small amount of dark brown head. nose is light on the apple brandy, but it s there. there is chocolate, malt, vanilla, brandy, boozy, cracker, and cinnamon. the apple brandy is subdued in the flavor as well, but it layers the base beer nicely. in comparison to the brandy zhukov, this is far more balanced. mouthfeel is medium to thick, with good carbonation, and a long finish. lives up to the hype, another superb barrel treatment of hunahpu. the apple brandy compliments the base beer (which is an unreal imperial stout) very well."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"big thanks to adam on this one.  aroma: lots of chocolate and vanilla, cinnamon, slight hints of the apple brandy, molasses, cocoa, fairly sweet, noticeable alcohol.  pours like black ink, very viscous, faint brown head dissipates fairly quickly.  flavor is fantastic - starts with a hefty dose of chocolate, like chocolate cake without being overly sweet.  apple notes, some warming alcohol, earthy/woody hints, coffee, molasses, roast malts, medium bitterness with minimal hop character.  the vanilla is fairly pronounced and the cinnamon is certainly present, the heat from the peppers has dissipated compared to the base, but is still just barely lurking in the background.  extremely full bodied without being overly sweet, just the right amount of carbonation, very smooth and silky.  an excellent beer, glad i was able to try it."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this beer. 

the beer pours a black color with a huge brown head. the aroma has a ton of chocolate in it, as well as some roasted malt, oak and brandy. the flavor is similar. upfront i get a ton of sweet apple brandy notes, with some chocolate and roasted malt coming through as well. i get a hint of spiciness and pepper, but the brandy and chocolate come through the strongest. thick mouthfeel and medium carbonation. awesome."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"growler, big thanks kan. aroma of paper, caramel, cinnamon, dark chocolate bar, chilies, sweet green apple. flavors are sweet caramel and apples but good burst of chilies, dark chocolate, raisin, and spicy finish. thick body. getting some slight papery oxidation but hurts it a bit. not sure it s better than the base or the bourbon but it s really tasty."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"first and foremost, thank you adam! 

smells like a really sweet hunahpus, seriously. the chocolate and cinnamon are present but the chili is very subdued, although i can still get the heat a little on the back of my tongue. taste is very rich and sweet. almost fudge like. definitely get the brandy and slight tart. this is just outstanding. some vanilla in there for sure. somewhat roasty as well. i love it. better than the original."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,sampled at small peen.  i just had after regular hunahpu.  i hated it.  this definitely takes the edge off the pepper.  brandy is gentle but cannot over come the negatives of the pepper.  not a strong enough base.  for me anyway.
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"growler. viscous inky think unctuous black. huge chalky sweet woody rich mint chocolate white chocolate coffee crumble. soft. oily. hunapuh spice masala late. early flavors dark chocolate, sweet plum seems muddled at first because palate needs to attenuate to appreciate and to notice the cinnamon. but then when the tongue is coated, yum. not as smooth and sublime as original but yummy and fun.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"growler (6/18/12) shared by umr_urgefan- thanks again, paul! pours an inky, dark, opaque brown with almost no head whatsoever. aroma of vanilla, chocolate, oak, berries, apples, molasses, caramel, and soy. flavor of vanilla, caramel, cola, oak, chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and then some subtle smoke and peat on the finish, maybe with a hint of the spices. the spice from the base beer is very subdued here. medium-full bodied, with a silky smooth mouthfeel and low-moderate carbonation. pretty damn sweet. the barrel takes over in this one. excellent, and looking forward to having it again in a few weeks. re-rate: well, it s been a few weeks, so we had it again along with a 2010 bottle (number 37 of 84) that was shared by sean9669- thanks, sean! the 2010 wasn t quite as tasty as the 2012; it had smooth apple brandy, molasses, vanilla, caramel, and oak in the nose; the flavor was just as smooth and rich, with low carbonation. it just didn t pop like the 2012, which is every bit as good as the regular, whiskey, and bourbon hunahpu s, and which was the overall winner for our tasting group. it s just a little too sweet for me to put it above those other three, but it s damn good. a singular drinking experience."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"2012 growler and on tap. best hunahpu s treatment. smooth and so good. i want to bathe in this. chilis on the back end, spices kick around there but the barrel gives this great sweetness, it is so smoooooth!"

the beer is black. the appearance is oily and viscous. atop the beer rests an inch of dense, beige head that hangs out for the duration. cigar city sure makes some good looking stouts.

the aroma offers less cinnamon and spice than the standard hunahpu s. beautiful dark roast and chocolate aromas, along with oak, vanilla, and a light boozy sweetness.

the flavor is fantastic. the brandy character gains momentum as the beer is allowed to warm. well balanced, teeming with flavor, complex, unique. yeah man. another amazing stout from cigar city. what a treat."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"this was the first beer i ever took notes on...and still one of the best beers i have ever had...served on-tap into a mini snifter at capone s during the cigar city party for philly beer week 2010...wow that was a lot of words...




a - pours absolutely pitch black with a small dark brown head that leaves sticky brown lacing down most of the glass.




s - a bit on the sweet side with a strong aroma of brandy. a bit of chocolate and some sort of spices? could that be the chillies from the non-ba version? i might need another glass to determine if it is...




t - starts out with some mild sweetness from the apple brandy slowly developing into an amazing line-up of cinnamon, chocolate, and some faint spices. most of the things i don t like about the normal version of hunahpu s are all cleared up with the barrel aging. absolutely one of the best stouts i have ever had. i can only hope to have it again in the future.




m - heavy body and flavor with good carbonation. it has a very full body but it is very well rounded. the brandy flavor is strong but not too overpowering.




o - i could drink this all day. i drank it side by side with regular version and it was like drinking a completely different beer. this one was so much more complex and smooth. absolutely amazing. so glad i got to try this one."

t-roasted malts up front with notes of chocolate cake and a touch of wood.  the brandi comes in behind as the strong malts move sweet.  the spices of thanksgiving are underneath with the back end offering sweet dark plums and cherries.

m-full bodied and chewy, this is extremely thick, a real sipper.  assertively carbonated to balance the robust body not losing anything from the barrel.

d-extremely well balanced with great complexity and fantastic flavors. i true sipper that provides full flavors that are well integrated and uniquely crafted.  best cc beer i ve had and actually lives up to the hype."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"a: the pour is almost black with a nice viscosity and almost no head.

s: there s a slightly metallic note at first, but it seems to diminish as the beer sits in the glass. i get a lot of chocolate to begin with. the chili note is there, too, but is sort of overwhelmed by the oak, brandy, roast, and coffee.

t: surprisingly oaky at the first sip. there s some nice brandy flavor here and the barrel provides some spicy notes and tannins. quite a bit of milk chocolate and a nice chili flavor in the background.

m: the body is medium to full with a low, but smooth carbonation.

d: i think i actually still like the regular hunahpu s the best, but this was quite good. i wouldn t turn down another glass of this."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"(bottle, one million thanks to beerlando) pours super black with a small dark brown head. the aroma holds well-integrated brandy, but i don t know if it makes the beer better? lots of chocolate/ cocoa and aromatic coffee with a nice, more subtle backup from the spices. undertones of apple, dried fruits/prunes, tobacco, vanilla, coconut and wood alongside a light milkiness. the roast is not super aggressive, yet light burned. the hops are not over the top, it just makes it more complex. fruity with notable alcohol warmth. very peppery as the beers gets warmer. some teriyaki on the nose. the flavour is near medium sweet, medium bitter and tiny acidic the taste is a nice mix of dark bitter chocolate, brandy, mild chilly spices, heavy roasted malt and light molasses. the mouthfeel is super fat, oily and smooth with a light, soft carbonation. burned malt, balanced hops and buttery oak lingers in the finish. full bodied. near fantastic, but i like the regular hunahpu better."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"cigar city brandy hunahpus (bottle number 65 of 84). thanks to sean.  in celebration of his engagement and my 2000th rating... pours a smooth  
viscous deep black pour, silky in nature, with a thin wispy dark khaki  
head... aroma is laiden with sweet brandy forwardness, semi- 
bittersweet velvety chocolate, while the chiles are still quite  
apparent and noticeable which is equally impressive for that matter. some char and  
light ash from the base zhukov providing some complimentary details to an already beautiful nose... flavors are a smooth transition from  
the aroma with an equally rich and assertive profile. semi-charred  
from the base zhukov which then evolves to a richer atmosphere with brandy  
along with its fruity esthers. chocolate tones are quite evident, so  
rich and so smooth and semi-sweet in nature. chiles surface every now  
and again which is a pleasant surprise as i was expecting for this quality to have fallen off due to its age and time spent in the barre. body is thick and filling, almost  
fudgy. carbonation is light but noticeable. abv is slightly warming overall but really held at bay for the most part. quite the experience and  
well worth it for such a milestone.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle 23 of 84. pours black with milk chocolate brown head. nose of brandy, vanilla bean, assorted chilis and cocoa powder. taste is simply divine and can best be described as assorted chili peppers wrapped in cocoa leaves resting on a bed of vanilla beans. some oak and brandy are present giving a deeper character to the beer. short and to the point, it tastes like a rich, chili-infused milkshake. simply amazing!"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"on tap at ccb during the hunahpu s release party. 

a: look was very similar to regular hunahpu s, as well as bourbon hunahpu s, which made for some fun at the table. very dark black with a very rich deep tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing. 

s: the smell of brandy is immediately present alongside all of those other beautiful scents that come along with the regular version. it s quite nice and not overpowering, but at the same time i m not sure it really complements the essence of the hunahpu s all that much. left me wondering whether a ""humidor series"" hunahpu s would have been even more outstanding. still, very beautiful nose that i won t actually complain about.

t: very similar assessment to the nose. the brandy actually did work pretty well, and i think this is true more so for the taste than the nose; however, still not quite a perfect 5. again, didn t like the taste as much as the standard hunahpu s, as i felt that some of the more subtle flavors from the original version might have a bit lost.

m: superb. very thick and viscous and good carbonation for the style. 

d: very beautiful. although not nearly as drinkable as the standard version, that one was well past the standard 5.0, so i have no problem giving that to the brandy version as well. just a beautiful sipping beer.

serving type: on-tap

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle compliments of douglas88: pitch black color with a thin tan head; very mild carbonation but just enough to to overpower. deep vanilla notes in the nose with a hot soy and butter flash after that followed with a tiny hint of molasses and astringent vegetal notes more akin to chipotle or smoked paprika. the flavor continues the fun with a thick sappy roasted jam smack in the middle of the palate with a creamy oak and vanilla note. the finish is long and sticky, plenty to pick apart for those opt to do so, but this ride is worth throwing your arms in the air and screaming for the next turn."

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"(750ml bottle #64/89 thanks to ericandersnavy) cigar city does it again. another imperial stout that just knocks it out of the park. black pour, coats the glass like motor oil with a few tan bubbles. nose of cinnamon, brandy, chile peppers, fudge, and alcohol when swirled in the glass. taste of brandy, smooth, fudge, cinnamon, mild alcohol, bourbon notes, medium dry finish with espresso in the linger. complex and surprisingly easy to drink for 11%. so smooth. i liked this better than regular hunahpu s."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"i never would have gotten to try this if it wasn t for the kind heartedness of tampa.  i shared this down at the bottle release of the freetail ananke.  as soon as i popped the bottle, people were lining up behind me for a pour.  it poured black as can be with a copper colored head.  aroma was lots of dark goodness, some oak character, slight brandy, and just so much goodness intertwining with one another.  the flavor was dark chocolate, fudge, brandy, and just a hint of spicyness that was being covered by the brandy in my opinion.  the body is thick like a milk shake.  i can t believe how good this thing is.  i am truly honored to have tried this."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"bottle. this thing pours a very, very thick black/brown color wtih minimal head. coats the glass and almost leaves legs running down. whoa! brandy, brandy, and more brandy are in the nose along with dark, raosted malts, vanilla, and some spice but for sure the brandy takes center stage. the flavor is extremely intense and complex at the same time. the brandy again is the first flavor you are hit with followed by the roast, vanilla, and spice. heavy mouthfeel. some tobacco and leather in the taste as well. a very intense sipper that is pretty well done. tough to drink a ton of it for me due to the intense brandy taste, i wish the brandy was just a little dialed down."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"2010 bottle number 61/84 with a big thanks to alen. pours with an inky, staining body and a small white head that fades to nothing. completely glass coating. aroma is lightly smokey, strong apple brandy, chocolate, fudge, spicy, nose burn, oily, iodine, cinnamon. taste is huge, chocolaty, chewy, ashy, cocoa, bready, and some cinnamon. no peppers (thankfully), and less chalky than the regular version. huge, thick, mouthcoating with light carbonation."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"on draft at capones.  pours a pitch black with a small to medium sized brown head.  aroma of spicy peppers, vanilla, brandy and chocolate.  taste of spicy peppers, brandy, vanilla, cocoa and light cinnamon.  tasty stuff."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"tap @ the brewery release on 5/22...pour was such a deep, black color with almost no head to speak of.  nose had strong notes of the barrel, chocolate and cinnamon but the brandy notes seemed to hide the chiles more than i expected.  thick as f*#@...coats the glass like no other brew i ve had outside of dark lord.  flavors consisted of heavy woodiness, brandy, some plum, chocolate and spice...again, the chiles seem to be missing.  very minor complaint about the chile notes, not enough for me to dislike this in any manner though.  world-class brew."
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"on tap at hawthornes. 8oz pour in tulip glass.
a: pitch black. no head, no skim, no lacing. just a thick motor oil look alike.

s: light apple brandy lays atop the profile from start to finish. underneath are spicy chili peppers, cinnamon, roasted malt, cocoa and traces of vanilla and oak.

t: like the nose, its clear right away that the beer was treated with some time in apple brandy barrels. it isn;t overwhelming however and complements the rich spicy flavors of the base beer well. chili peppers pop out on the tongue and are rounded out with sweet cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla and a bit of caramel.

m: thick and smooth. lightly carbonated (in a good way). a bit of warming heat, but not overpoweringly boozy.

o: i plowed through this beer fairly quickly (unintentionally). it just went down real well despite its massive body and substantial flavoring. as noted above this was much better than the pour i got the day before at capones. its amazing how different they were. capones was almost all brandy, killing off the peppers and cinnamon. the hawthorne s sample really was like hunahpus + apple brandy... which was nice to get. cigar city guys... do you guys know what happened to the capone s keg???"
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged,3.5,"thanks for sharing this rarity, nick.

black as pitch and quite viscous, there isn t much of a head, but it does have nice legs.

it smells strangely muddled. bittersweet dark chocolate, a touch of tart apple, some leathery oxidation. the barrel aging seems to have actually simplified the beer and covered up most of the pepper, vanilla and cinnamon. as it warms, it becomes dominated by heavily roasted, tarry, almost burnt malt and sweet brandy. not bad, but haphazard.

the apple brandy flavor comes through pretty strongly on the palate. it hints at apple, but it s more of an indistinguishable fruity sweetness. there s a little vanilla and oak, lots and lots of bitter baking chocolate, barely perceptible chili pepper. this is a huge, chewy imperial stout, almost dark lord-esque in viscosity. the finish is mildly boozy with lingering flavors of bitter chocolate, licorice, earthy oxidation and faint chili pepper. barrel aging seems to have covered up the boldness of the adjunct ingredients in this beer, transforming it into something that s enjoyable but ultimately muddled. perhaps hunahpu s wasn t the best beer to put in a barrel. pretty good, i enjoyed my glass, but it s not outstanding. there are a number of better and less rare barrel aged imperial stouts out there."

Off Color Waddle,3.9,"12oz bottle and on tap at the mousetrap. in a lot of ways doesn't approximate a fest beer. deeper, thick malts. approaching dunkel, but the lagering is spot on so it kind of nails it too. a little heavy handed on the specialty malts i suppose, but still a delicious, unique offering. big ups tooch!!!"
Off Color Waddle,3.9,pour is a clear copper with a fizzy small head. aroma is fine with just enough malty breadyness. flavor is a bit sweet with some brown sugar and some grainy malt. a little too much sweetness for me as i like my marzen to be like bone dry dark bread. must have been the polka.
Off Color Waddle,3.9,"bottle. deep orangey gold pour, white head with okay retention. nose is caramelly malt, dried leaves, candied orange peel (smells like my favorite season of the year... and the harbinger of football season!). mouth is medium bodied, toasty caramel malts, bread, touches of vanilla and candied yams. another tasty beer from chicago's brewing version of the nutty professor. prost!"
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,barrel p chapter. smells like Christmas. lots of cinnamon and of course it feels like a Merry Christmas to me l. soft and balanced good and sip!
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"fat tv the bruery is tested p chapter. here we have soft fine kr me cinnamon juice. have exactly s . Have a very nice Christmas. Slightly carbonated as it should be.  yes, quite good indeed"
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"probably the best horchata beer i've tried so far. the cinnamon and vanilla are nice, not too much. splitting a 16 oz is perfect."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"473ml can, ""2022 edition"". pours a hazy golden amber with a small off-white head. aroma of vanilla, cinnamon. taste is sweet, creamy vanilla/lactose, cinnamon definitely there but seems somewhat mild against the sweetness, pale malts and caramel. medium bodied. expected a bit more spiciness and to be insanely sweet based on past reviews, but it seems they've found a good a balance now and this was pretty decent imo."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"can, 0.473l. aroma of vanilla, cinnamon, cereals, flowers and yoghurt. pours cloudy dark golden color with medium sized creamy white head and sparkling appearance. taste starts with sweet vanilla, coconut and cinnamon, following is sweet tropical fruity and milky, mouthfeel is smooth and mild spicy, while finish almost without any bitterness. full body, oily to slightly sticky texture and average carbonation in palate. milkman s beer.."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"1 pint can - yes it is american. pours just off clear like a slightly hazy pale ale with a low, quickly fading head. so it looks like beer. it smells like some sort of herbal, milky spiced drink you might find in a vegan cafe. not bad, just not beer. tastes fine, quite sweet with the milkiness from the lactose predominant with a bit of vanilla & then spice which they say is cinnamon. who knows if there are any hops in it as us beers don't seem to have to list any ingredients. only loosely a ""beer"" imho but fun to try. i'd guess if you like horchata then you would like this. the 7.2%abv is very well hidden btw. enjoy carefully."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"april 7th, 2016 - 

much spicier than i anticipated. smells like a banana or richly vanilla flavored froyo. a touch of flan, but not so much of that caramelization. a high, clean, pearly scent too, something i associate with iris.

flavor is basically exactly the same, but with coconut and shea butter that lasts well into the aftertaste. mouthfeel is soft, medium weight, perfect for the flavor. very tropical here, like the smell of my father's old sunscreen from beach trips when i was growing up. and then it hits me. actually, this tastes dead on like a beer mixed with mai tai."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"light brown clear with white foam. smells like cinnamon rolls. medium body. s t. cinnamon bun also to taste, some vanilla and lactose. but went well with pizza with banana and curry sauce.."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"fairly clear golden coloured body with a nice, rich three centimetre tall off-white head, microfoamed and very long-lasting. aroma of lactose, cream, pepper, canella, nutmeg and a dash of cacao as well - quite strong in the nose. medium to full-bodied; super rich chocolate and spice flavours dominate with a lot of malt - bunches of alcohol, but more lactose and pure caster sugar than anything else - quite strong throughout. aftertaste shows the pungent spices like nutmeg and canella, quite strongly with a good balance from some deep malts, pungent lactose and rich caster sugar, all ending with a strong alcohol and yeast presence that seems like it finishes a bit higher in alcohol than it really is. overall, a rich and deep beer throughout that has a lot of character, bunches of flavour and a pungent finish that hits the right notes and is completely unique, flavourful and pungent. nice to sample and well-recommended if you like new/different tastes in a beer. i sampled this sixteen ounce, pint-sized can, purchased from whole foods in arlington (pentagon city), virginia on 06-september-2019 for us$3,49 sampled just two days later at home in washington on 08-september-2019."

The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,from a 16 oz can into a stem glass.  pours cloudy gold with head and lace.  aroma of a cherry vanilla soda with cinnamon.  significant carbonation and mouthfeel.  flavors of a vanilla cream soda with slight cinnamon and alcohol.  overall odd but fun and tasty if you're into beers that don't taste like traditional beers!
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"aroma of cinnamon, anise, vanilla, and apple. taste is cake, cinnamon, syrup, yeast and then a slam of vanilla at the end. interesting, but not something i'd be searching out."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"can. light grain for the malt, perfume for the hpps, dough for yeast, with light dried fruit, white wine, with a big hit of cinnamon in the background. head is small, fizzy turning wispy, with no lacing and is fully diminishing. color is clear medium amber. flavor starts moderately to heavily sweet and slightly acidic, then finishes moderately sweet and faintly bitter. palate is on the fuller side of medium, oily, with a soft to lively carbonation. nice easy drinking flavored golden ale, with a not so subtle note of cinnamon."

The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"draught at hogwash, small bubbly head, hazy yellow color, aroma of shrubs, minerals and spice, flavor of almonds and shrubs, a bit sour, some sweetness, doesn't blend together. strange, not too great."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"16oz can.  pours a golden orange color and capped by a small off white layer of foam that fades away quickly to a thin film.  the aroma shows notes of rice, grainy malts, cinnamon, and vanilla over a toasted caramel malt base.  the flavor follows suit with notes of cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel up front to go with the pale and caramel malts, milk sugar, and sweetness with no real balancing bitterness.  medium bodoed and smooth with good carbonation that leads to a sweet cinnamon, vanilla, and toasted caramel on the finish.  just too sweet and heavy for me to drink much of.  i get what they were going for, but not really my thing at all."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"bottle brought by a fellow local. hazy bronze colour. small, somewhat bubbly head. insane aroma of cinnamon and vanilla bean. taste is also plenty of vanilla and cinnamon. a bit of pastry, also."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"@ l.a.

colour: golden, a bit of haze
aroma:  artificial vanilla, cinnamon, tropical fruits, spicy.
taste: medium body, medium carbonation, really sweet, spices, cinnamon. sweet& spicy medium long aftertaste. 
really odd brew to be a beer."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"pours a clear, golden amber coloration with a medium, fluffy head. smell is quite unique, dominated by sweet'ish, biscuity, grainy malt and cinnamon and vanilla, with the cinnamon standing out particularly. taste follows the nose, with sweet'ish biscuity, grainy and slightly caramelly malts and cinnamon and vanilla absolutely dominating and very little hops coming through, although there is mild estery yeast presence to this as well, with hints of apple and clove/nutmeg. finishes semi-dry, with a light sweetness and some cinnamon and vanilla lingering in the aftertaste. soft mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation. i never had horchata, but this kinda reminds me of cinnamon rice pudding, especially the aroma, which goes in kind of a similar direction, i think. anyway, while this is a rather unusual brew, there definitely is a great balance of sweetness and spicyness going on here, which lends a sweet character to this that never becomes cloying through, even finishing somewhat semi-dry. i'm not really a huge fan of cinnamon-heavy beers and this generally particularly to my taste, but i still enjoyed it well enough due to its uniqueness and good balance."

taste: lots of nutmeg and black pepper, cinnamon, toast and some caramel, medium sweetness, medium bitterness

overall: lots of spicy flavor is present which is obviously out of balance. interesting during the first sips but it gets boring quite easily later on."

The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"on tap in manhattan. pale belgian ale appearance. scent is nearly scentless to my nose. taste is quite sweet, clearly additive heavy, smooth chocolate milk flavors with some semisour lime properties. orange. finish is lingering citrus. very good, but hugely additive heavy, and a little muddied/identity crisis situation."
The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,"golden colour, clear. white head, one finger, decent retention. soft carbonation visually. watery texture with little fizz. aroma is cinnamon, clove, rice, lactose sweetness. spicy and sweet. taste is rice with milk, cinnamon and clove. traces of vanilla and coriander. sweet. the cinnamon is not over the top, by any means, so i can't understand most of the bad reviews saying is pure cinnamon. don't think it's really clever to buy a beer with this name and expect it to be the way you like it to be. you don't go to a gore movie and then complain about the blood. you don't go to a musical and then complain about too many songs. so, yeah, almost like horchata, really good and radical job."

The Bruery Or Xata (2015-),3.8,pour is a hazy orange with a large white head. aroma is just enough cinnamon with some rice flour. flavor is more of just a barely there cinnamon and vanilla with some dry wheat malt. not overly flavorful but the additions were there just not to the extreme which i'm used to from this brewer. the canned on date was 10/23/18 so this was not old but again this was fine but could have used more umph from the adjuncts.

Founders Frootwood,3.8,one of the best! fantastic l with such a very persistent taste and so many nuances that it just has to be tried.
Founders Frootwood,3.8,"nice marriage of cherries, maple and bourbon barrell. intense, sweet but drinkable."
Founders Frootwood,3.8,"from the already very well-known brewery founders (u.s.a.) this recipe with cherries from its barrel aged line called frootwood which does not mention the base style but on the label they describe it as a cherry ale aged in barrels of maple syrup and bourbon contains a power of 8% abv, let's try what can be found in this unique experiment what qualities has this fruit beer absorbed from the wood and how has it evolved? 
in appearance it is a beer with a scarce foam crown formed by fine pearls, ephemeral retention, low carbonation activity, very striking and cloudy bright reddish color, on the walls of the glass it drains slowly predicting a silky body. The aroma is quite complex, a consistent sweetness can be appreciated, the character of the barrel is very vibrant, at least on the nose, obviously the cherries are the main thing, notes of raisins, vanilla, cake are also developed, very difficult to describe and decipher. in flavor it is predominantly sweet and it is leveled out a bit with the alcoholic and woody contribution of the barrels, the cherry is perfectly exposed, you can also find tastes of raisins, plums, vanilla and honey, all in a texture that envelops the palate, present that could possibly develop an acidity due to the fruits but there is no trace of such character, everything has been well rounded, matured and polished, even the alcohol is well amalgamated and is felt to be an elemental part both in sensation and flavor, nothing is known about the hops, a different beer that I could not say has a similar one and although the profile is not entirely to my liking I must accept that it is quite complex in more than one sense."
Founders Frootwood,3.8,"12 oz bottle with a 12/16 bottling date

look: pours clear dark red-copper. medium off-white head has a slightly pink coloration. the head has good retention. 

aroma: interesting aroma with a strong impact from the barrel aging (mainly wood notes), sweet bourbon and cherries. subtle touch of maple. 

flavor: less woody with good balance: sweet cherries up front with a suggestion of tart cherries by the finish. subtle maple and light bourbon. very fine, lingering aftertaste.

m: medium bodied; near medium carbonation; sticky.

overall: certainly an interesting and well crafted ale. the maple bourbon barrels are milder than might be expected while the cherries are more up front. nonetheless, i think this ale lives up to its potential."
Founders Frootwood,3.8,cherry dominates but in both aroma and flavor bourbon and hints of the maple show up to. flavor has a slightly tart cast to it.
Founders Frootwood,3.8,"12 ounce bottle


if you like your fruit beers a little more bold and aggressive than normal look no further than founders. this heavy beer made me wonder what would happen if you barrel aged some belgian red or other similar release for a few months. while a little spendy everyone should a chance to try this once.



aroma / appearance - the calm cherry colored core looks like a melted collection of cough drops. the fresh white head contrasts that with a bright bleached essence. maple syrup drizzled over a fresh hot slice of cherry pie warms the air as hints of vanilla sneak in from time to time. the smooth creamy texture almost forms a wall of sweetness.



flavor / palate - belgian cherries soaked in maple syrup warm the tongue, throat, and every crevice of the mouth they can find. a refreshing full body never overstays its welcome. balancing depth with drinkability, it sacrifices neither. i had high expectations from this due to the founders brand and it not only met them but managed to exceed in many ways. if you are looking for a world class midwestern sour this one fits the bill."

Wolverine State Barista Coffee Lager,3.8,"from notes. i had this one on draft at the brewery on march 18 after a hockey game. the pour is a nice darker brown color that has a thin light tan head that lingers a bit, offering a little lac3e. the aroma is pretty good. it does smell like coffee, as one could hope. there is a hint of chocolate in this one with a light bitterness from the roasted malts. the flavor is definitely heavy in the coffee. this one is just as advertised. there is a nice bitterness associated with the coffee, and the rest of the notes from the nose just fall by the way side here. it s very intensely coffee. the mouth feel is thin and light with a decent carbonation to help it out, but it is almost like a heavy cup of cold coffee. the aftertaste is all bitter roasted coffee with little else helping out. it s not terrible, but you have to really enjoy coffee for this one."

Refreshing, strong first sip. Full-bodied, strong-spicy body with strong effervescence, notes of yeast, alcoholic yeast dough, light stone fruits, a pleasant and well-integrated bitterness and acidity and various aromas of herbs, perhaps even a little of thyme. Long, herbal-spicy, slightly bitter and sour, warm and creamy aftertaste. All-round convincing, very tasty triple that stands out with its herbal spiciness, the explosion of flavor in the body, the very well-integrated 8.4% alcohol, bitterness and acidity. Would gladly drink it again!"

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"Served in a tulip, golden in colour, with an abundant and creamy head of foam. Delicious and quite complex aroma of Belgian yeast, bread, cereals, banana, orange, floral... it is a beer that is enjoyed both through the nose and the mouth. Light body, soft, velvety texture, citrus tones, malt, cereals... slightly acidic, perfectly balanced, it evolves to sweeter tones both in the mouth and on the nose throughout the tasting. Excellent beer, a must try."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"bottle from cheers liquor store, todmorden.  golden with thick creamy-frothy head.  fruity nose, more belgian wheat styling in taste.  has a carbonation notable in taste, which does hide its strength well."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"the karmeliet tripel does not have an ingredients list in a language that i understand, so i can only guess sugar and spices. the smell suggests coriander and orange, but it is very nicely executed and not pungent. the head is medium-pored and lush with medium stability. the color is golden yellow and cloudy. on the first sip, it has a soapy mouthfeel with a dry overall impression. orange and coriander set the tone here and the beer aroma is unfortunately covered. carbonation is very intense and also disturbing for me. this means that the alcohol is well integrated. on the finish, the orange comes out even more strongly, which also sticks to the palate. a tripel that emphasizes the characteristics of the beer style so strongly that it can hardly be called a beer anymore. for me, one of the weakest tripels. 10-2020"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"tap at nomad. 1 dollar! peppery banana touched aroma. deep yeast tone. soft, pillowy body. mineral faint hop balance. really mellow and creamy, the body makes it work as compared to brewpub us examples which fully miss that facet. really nice on tap, different experience."

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"blonde pour with lemon hues. massive white foam head. visible sediments swirling. aroma of banana and lemon. hints of clove and candied fruits. good fruity flavor with moderate sourness. more banana. well-balanced, full-bodied and satisfying. the earthy grains give it a nice, signature taste. further sipping unveils robust coriander and orange peel notes, similar to a witbier. warming. the bottle states the recipe is from the 17th century which is amazing in itself. i wonder how much it has been tweaked to satisfy modern consumers. i m rating it slightly lower than the median average due to redundancy and over-saturation within this style. nevertheless, it s a solid tripel that will unquestionably quench your thirst."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"very good superstrong wheat beer. tastes very good, very tasty liquid. not bad"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"pours a very hazy dark golden with a not too big (especially per style), compact white head, which doesn't show much retention and most of all no lacing. smell is mostly a mix of sirupy/sugary sweetness and yeasty notes (dough), with a background of fruitiness (peach most prominent, lighter pear) and slight hints of spiciness. quite vivid, but not very refined. taste is worst. very strong sugary/sirupy sweetness upfront, a background of fruitiness (banana, peach, pear) and nothing else. very sweet in both taste and aftertaste, barely saved from cloyingness by alcohol attenuation. medium to dense body, medium or slightly above medium carbonation, possibly a bit lower than style average. aims for a softer mouthfeel than most tripels, feels ok at that but gets maybe a bit too sticky. overall still drinkable, but far from quality stuff."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"750 ml bottle. golden colour, big head with good durability, fair lacing, strong carbonation. nose is yeast, grain, notes from green apple. flavour is medium sweet and bitter, dominant malty, yeast, banana, warming alcohol. perfect mouthfeel, long finish. pretty good!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"appearance: golden color, opalescent. white head, medium-high, made of medium and small bubbles, falls to the last layer, leaving spots on the glass. 
aroma: medium volatile, balanced. banana esters with a peach note at a medium level come out slightly in front. right behind them are medium peppery, slightly clove phenols boosted by earthy spicy hops and raw scythe, sharp wheat with a bread note. 
taste: the start is sweet esters, mainly banana with peach notes at a medium level, additionally strengthened by delicate bready sweetness. later, the sweetness of the esters and sodium is balanced by peppery, slightly clove-like phenols at a similar level and low, spicy, slightly earthy hops and the sharpness of wheat scythe. dry in the mouth, medium-low body, medium-high carbonation. bitterness is low, negligible, spicy. finish is dry with notes of maria and banana, wheat, pepper and roots."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"clear yellow with great white head. smell of malt, yeast and ""rain on a summer day"". taste of malt, wheat, flowers, honey, banana, yeast. very smooth and with a nice aftertaste.

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"great belgie this. 

readily available now in the big uk supermarkets for  5 a wine bottles worth. great session any time of the year. 

i find this delightfully easy drinking yet complex. even in the premier belgian beer field this has a lot going on and time is needed. 

smell and taste are twinning. a soup of malt! yet cutting through this are some clean floral hops. bitterness takes over at the right moment. then finishing with bananas on the bbq, honey, mint, fresh soaked aniseed, butter, lemon. 

it's so warming yet so refreshing. the carbonation is really dialled up which encourages sipping. not a bad thing for this beer. 

cracking."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"golden pour with a hint of haze - big white head. aromas of grain/oats, some caramel and spices - similar for the tase.

quite nice, but could have stronger flavours for a tripel."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"draught at belgobar. clear dark golden with lasting laces. spicy and peppery aroma. taste of belgian yeast, pepper and grapefruit."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"golden, opalescent. no persistence and the foam is dominated by coriander in the aroma. in the taste salty, coriander. low bitterness. medium fullness, medium carbonation."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"aroma of corriander, malt, yeast. taste of corriander, spice, malt, banana, candy. pretty good."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"bottle at fergies. slightly hazy honey gold pour. big carbonation. huge fluffy head. modestly grand with a complex profile. toasted oats and light caramel toffee. belgian florals. clove. lavender. pepper. some mild bittering hops in the middle. faint notes of straw, leather, and tobacco. feels like a lighter well-carbonated version of a richer quad. very well balanced. quietly substantial but easy drinking."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"beer with gold color, clear to fuzzy aspect, medium bitterness, average carbonized, good volume of foam on top (bought a 33 cl bottle beer at ""carrefour"", antwerpen, be #1296)(#31 be)(#4 east flanders)."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"tall, white head from a very gentle, drizzle down the side pour. audible fizziness as i pour, almost like a soft drink. very good retention leaving sticky lacing (and a nicely laced empty chalice). slightly hazy golden body, heavily carbonated.

the aroma is not too strong, but sweet. bubblegum, and a bit of banana.

the flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. the middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. the finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. this aftertaste is exquisite!

the mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, i keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. moderate body.

karmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet. the feel of the aftertaste is, as i stated above, exquisite. wow!

an excellent tripel!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,fruity flavors are well blended together.  very complex flavors.  caramel with some toffee.  rich all around. well done!
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"classic belgium palate, and less subtle than others. with some tripels you could miss the complexity if you drink too quick, but the complexity of this one carries on like a tired toddler long after you have taken the sip"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"Dark amber color, slightly cloudy, with a white foam with medium bubbles, initially thick but not very persistent, leaving a persistent white ring after a few minutes. Foam with medium retention.
On the nose it is sweet, fruity, spicy, with apple, peach, citrus, oregano, and Belgian yeasts standing out.
On the palate it is very pleasant. It starts with a fruity and floral sweetness, with citrus and apple standing out, which is immediately balanced by the appearance of herbs, oregano, and coriander, which persists until the end. Hidden, you can feel the toasted malt and the Belgian yeast characteristic of the style, a subtle note of honey, vanilla, and banana. The carbonation is good and at the end there is a spiciness in the aftertaste. It is pleasantly liqueur-like at the end."

the scent is slightly spicy, green, malty, sweet and the classic Belgian cold scent.

definitely my favorite triple and one of my favorite l."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"bought a 33cl bottle from belgium. eye: a bit hazy, straw yellow beer with a white head. nose: some white wine sourness, sweet malts, biscuit and mild hops. tongue ; a lot of what the nose detected. then a bit more clover, belgian yeast and a hint of coriander.

overall: a nice triple. stands out because of its coriander citrus tastes.  very well balanced. i can see why this is a classic. for me the white chimay and westmalle work better."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,round and good. very traditional Belgian. absolutely right if that's what you're looking for. excellent for Christmas dinner!
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"three-grain brewed beer, amazing  herbal flavours, one of my favourite beers!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"golden straw color with just a little haze.  nice foamy head.  slight malty aroma, medium light body with very nice balance of malt, hop, ester and spice.  highly carbonated with a clean dry finish makes it very refreshing.  amazing beer!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"enjoyed in a small restaurant in Brussels, delicious. enjoying it as a nightcap after Italian food. maybe too fruity for that, but what the heck.
very floral on the nose, same in the drink, briefly slightly peppery, then fruit, later peppery again, complex finish, delicious. very drinkable."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"pours a clear, deep golden coloration with a large, fluffy head and visible carbonation. smells of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt and citrus zest, with estery hints of green apple and clove as well. taste is an excellent balance of doughy, slightly grainy and caramelly malt, hoppy citrus notes and fruity/spicy yeast esters of green apple, banana, clove and peppery spice. finishes with a medium sweetness and some caramel malt, citrus zest and peppery spice lingering in the aftertaste. effervescent mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium/strong carbonation.

this makes for quite a hoppy tripel with some distinct, floral and zesty citrus notes in addition to those fruity and spicy yeast esters, with the spice standing out as well. there really is an excellent balance of sweet malt, zesty hops and fruity/spicy yeast to this, making for a brew that feels rich and refreshing, complex and easy-drinking at the same time, while the abv is hardly noticeable as well and there really is a fantastic, full and effervescent mouthfeel to this. overall, this makes for a great tripel that is perhaps a bit more hoppy than most, but balanced so well that it really makes for an exceptionally pleasant drinking experience."

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"hints of vanilla and banana, very foamy with lots of gas. needs a large glass with round bottom. a duvel glass will do if you don't have the matching glass."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,absolutely a top triple in my opinion. very full and tasty.
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,last beer of belgium.  aroma has no bananas.  flavor is light of the same.  nice body where yeast overwhelms. stong fruit esters which is what i prefer.  nice lasting head.  enjoyable even in an airport
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"pours almost brown,medium head good resistance. strong carbonation, medium to moderate body. malty feeling all the way. very good balance. coriander, spices produce additional strongness. thumbs up."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"fruity. yeasty. banana. vanilla. wheat. oats. barley. creamy. spices. lemon. cloves. sweet honey. notable alcohol taste. 8.4% abv on an empty stomach at 3am. absolutely, damningly and satisfyingly potent   rich and flavourful. solid belgian tripel!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"Light golden yellow in the glass. Medium-sized perlage rises relatively slowly to the top. This already suggests that it is a rather dense affair. The white, medium-pored head of foam is incredibly stable and almost infinitely long-lasting.

Very dominant, fresh, slightly sweet herbal aromas are noticeable on the nose - pure perfume! After the beer has warmed up a little, a slightly fruity banana note is added.

The pleasantly fresh, almost soft, sweet-fruity first sip is immediately convincing. The middle part has lovely fruit aromas of yeast, banana, cantaloupe and very light dried fruit aromas. The freshness causes everything to foam up a little in the mouth and makes it very soft and smooth, but inhibits the sweetness, which is not relevant at all in a beer like this.

The aroma lasts for an unbelievably long time. The slightly warming, sweet and herbal aromas dominate at first. It is only after two or three minutes that the yeasty aromas come to the fore and remain for an incredibly long time. After several more minutes, fruity herbal aromas emerge that seem impossible to get rid of. Simply strong! An incredibly great beer with a very typical, voluminous but very charming aroma that is convincing across the board with an almost unique balance. A real treat from start to finish! World class!!"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"draft beer at the la rive campsite. very good belgian triple beer. the banana from the yeast comes out well and the aniseed finish is pleasant for those who like this taste.

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"330 ml bottle. pours clear golden with a huge white head and little volcanoes of bubbles persist. smells banana, apple, fruit sweetness, and a tinge of white pepper. tastes dry, a little citrusy, with some sweet banana, spicy clove and warming earthy spiciness. dries out with a snappy and bitter back end. high carbonation. this is better than i could have imagined and, at least from memory, the best tripel i've had."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"33cl bottle from a store. pours hazy golden with pearl white foam. great and rich aroma of yeast, vanille, flowers, malt, sugary..  very typical of belgian tripels. tastes very rich and heavy on wheat, also honey, vanille, citrus, banana and coriander.. lots of sweetness and very flavourful with a little grassy and spicy, dry finish. again lots of wheat in the taste, made with wheat, oat and barley. medium body and good carbonation, also strong at 8,5% abv. it's really sweet and rich among the tripels i tried. more spicy than bitter. fantastic taste."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"although not a trappist, but a classic. for me one of the best, if not the best tripel there is. perfect balance in aroma and taste. that's how a tripel is meant to be. also a nice story about the accompanying glass. when you can see a straight line in the belgian lace after drinking, you can safely grab another one."

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"Deep gold barely cloudy, fine beige foam very (too) abundant. Aromas: citrus, pear, banana, caramel, coffee, spices, pepper. Medium bitterness. Surprisingly balanced recipe where the high alcohol content is quickly forgotten in the face of the debauchery of flavors."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"a proper tasting of this after years. one of my favourite belgian of all times!
very aromatic, banana esters are very evident, with phenolic pepper-like notes, other yeasty esters include citrus peel. a sweet bready malty note is underneath. hop add a spicy and floral mild, but noticeable mark.
gold, hazy, well carbonated, large everlasting creamy head, great lacing.
sweet impression on the taste, with all the esters and the complex notes perceived in the aroma. some orange peel and banana stand up. flavours linger magically forever, finish is dry.
medium body, and wonderful creamy and highly carbonated mouthfeel. very smooth.

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"aug 2020  750ml corked and caged bottle, kept in the fridge for a hot day like this. spritzy and sherberty. a sort of wheaty belgian. nice, gentle perfume, candy sweet, touch of banana and citrus fruit. an ok beer. easy drinking. almost like pop. [3.3] 

june, 2012 330ml bottle chrissie brought back from bruge. hazy blonde with foamy head. ok. yeasty, wheaty nose with banana esters and woody and citric notes - some soap, faint spice, dry, mildly alcoholic. ok. mouthfeel is dry, chalky, mildly alcoholic, some carbonation prickles. ok. flavour is soft, with entwined and attractive notes of vanilla, citrus, flowers, soap and faint chocolate. the combination of all the elements is softly attractive and beguiling, though not especially impressive. it s a good, drinkable strong pale ale, rather like duvel or chimay white, and worth exploring further. i certainly enjoyed and appreciated it more this time than i did 10 years ago. [3.3]

sept, 2002 pale golden colour. nose is sherbety and spicy, with hints of vanilla, cloves, cinnamon and coriander, plus  bubblegum and a touch of soap. in the mouth it is quite honey sweet balanced by sour citrus-fruit notes - lemon and lime, with a touch of pineapple. finish is citrusy, sweet and cloying. chewy-thick, with a power taste suggesting a much higher alcohol content. [2.5]"
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"big bottle (75 cl) from systembolaget. first impression: wow, that's a lot of foam! aroma of sweet malt, caramel and corn. there's also another flavor of something i can't really define but very clearly says ""white wine"" to me. this most likely comes from the fermentation process. the flavor is fresh, quite sweet, and distinctively dry. the finish comes with some bitterness, however not that much. to me, this beer almost feels more like wine or a dry cider than a beer overall. however, as the beer gets warmer, it starts to feel more and more like a beer. despite the high alcohol content, it's not very noticeable. overall, i enjoyed it!"

Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"Belgian triple blonde beer with 8.4% alcohol, which falls in the glass with a platinum yellow colour, abundant foam with a creamy appearance and quite transparent.
On the nose, a multitude of aromas: honey, caramel, citrus...
Unctuous flavour, reminiscent of Belgian abbey beers, wheat beer and some fruity lambic. The aromas of the nose are evident together with many other new ones, such as the aforementioned wheat, some spices, quite a bit of malt, hops and barley. It is one of the few beers in which all the ingredients are differentiated in the mouth and complement each other. Much more body when drinking it than one might think from the initial colour. High carbonation when swallowing, the only and minimal but that I put on it.
It may be the industrial beer closest to the artisanal ones, worthy of praise... to drink slowly, enjoying and in moderation."
Tripel Karmeliet,4.4,"aroma: peaches, pears, citrus, lemon jelly, yeast and such Witbier notes of wheat. the whole thing is complemented by a nice floral note.
balanced taste. dominated by champagne notes (associated with peach non-alcoholic champagne) and spices like nutmeg and clove. behind them such ester (associated with pears) and sweetness. alcohol well hidden.
medium-high fullness, high carbonation, imperceptible bitterness."

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"four pack of tall boys, canned on 09-16-24, presumably kept cold the whole way down to bobkat liquors.  nose lovely, explosive tropical fruit with a bit of pith, lots of citrus, very bright and fresh.  pour hazy rich yellow-golden with a dense off-white head, mildest lace.  taste starts with a light-medium bitterness but likably so as all the sharp edges have been rounded off, just the smoothest bitterness ever, and that lasts for a long time, melds with mild booze in the aftertaste.  good low-level caramel throughout, touch woody, and that sticks around the teeth.  medium-full body is very juicy (again, strong citrus everywhere) and smooth, getting bright esters from the foundation and a wheat/rye highlight.  extremely fresh and natural, easy to forget it s a beer!   semi-dry, the sweetness never ever accumulates, making this extremely repeatable and there is no tang or sourness with just light alcohol for heft.  the yeast component sets this apart, just healthy, happy little guys working well with their hoppy colleagues.  perhaps not as revelatory as it would have been even five years ago, but really wins on the margins and finer points, top shelf.

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"long sought after, i finally located a 16 oz can at as is nyc yesterday. i poured a small amount in a provided glass to see what it looked like. a cloudy orange body with a nicely persisting head of absolutely white foam. it smelled hoppy certainly along with grain and tropical fruit. it tasted of cedar pine, hops, grapefruit, pineapple and dankness. there s a pretty decent bitterness. is it west coast or new england style? no matter, a fine beer although i anticipated something top level."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"white foamy full lasting head. deep honey colour. aroma is hoppy with fruity (citrus, tangerine, pineapple and mango) notes. flavor is hoppy too with fruity (pear, pineapple and papaya) tones, ending in in moderately hoppy finish. medium bodied."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"misty yellow beer with a white head of fine structure that stays for a while. I smell a fruity scent of mainly tropical fruit and citrus fruit (grapefruit, passion fruit). the taste is also fruity and due to the hops in the attack quite bitter. as the tasting progresses the bitterness decreases somewhat. fine full body."

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"five years i've been looking for this. i had given up finding it on the west coast until suddenly, there it was. two cans.

i poured into a glass before i read the instructions. it is hazy orange and gold with a small white head. i was immediately struck by the huge fruity citrus aroma. taste is equally big. some dipas are balanced in the sense that the flavor profile straddles the line between bitter and sweet by perfectly finding the middle. this one is different. it is intensely bitter and deliciously sweet - so much that it is two distinct experiences at once. the flavors are pineapple and mango and clementine. something dank and skunky sits in there, too, in the most delightful way, as they say. the experience is electric, with a full mouthfeel. this is easy to drink, and the high abv is well-hidden. 

i am very fortunate to have found this. i can't wait for my next encounter."

seriously? this is the top-rated imperial neipa? admittedly highly drinkable, but not overly flavourful, rather mineral and papery, neither overly impressive concerning appearance nor mouthfeel - hype seems to be all about drinkability and leadership in invention/introduction. kind of a late bloomer, would have been even more disappointing after having only the first sip."

grassy, silky and grapefruity with lots of notes going on from sweet vanilla, water melon, citrus, papaya, pomelo, subtle piney dankness, malty bread, and a creamy mouth coating dry bitterness.

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"sampled two different singles brought down to dc by two different people. the first one was already close to 2 months old when sampled....the 2nd on closer to 1 month. wish i could have tried this fresher, but got the general gist. leans west coast in style, with lots of bitterness. some tropical hops, but mostly has those resin & pine dank notes. grain bill has some malt to support the strong hop bitterness.  semi-clear medium yellow/orange to gold appearance.  will try to get this closer to can date next time."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"fourpack at the bennington vt grocery story.

*shrug*

it's a sticky caramelly dipa with some nice older-school hop character. nothing like the contemporary hazy neipas in that it's not using exclusively new-school hops; this is a tribute to c-hops with enough variety (amarillo?) to confer ample fruitiness. it's juicier than an old-school c-hop bomb though, and i'm sure was pretty damn impressive in 2011. in 2021, it's just a good dipa. maybe even a really good dipa. 

summary: a taste of beer history, not beer's future."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hazy, hoppy, and very smooth. so damn good. wish i could get it more on the west coast"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can (may 3, 2021 canning). head is initially small, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. body is cloudy light yellow. aroma is lightly malty (grain), lightly hoppy (orange), with light notes of raw green chile peppers, alcohol, acid reflux. flavor is heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. finish is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter, slightly unclean. medium to full body, watery/oily/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

despite being very fresh, there's virtually no hop aroma, and the weird green-peppery vegetal note (uncannily like jalape o peppers!) obscures what little hops there are (no wonder they want you to avoid pouring it, so you don't have to be so utterly disappointed in the aroma...gotta love marketing, 'cause obviously it's working). very syrupy-oily sweet in the mouth, with just barely enough to balance. a bit below average, but i guess that's not saying too much in the world of murky ipas..."

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"after moving away and having a lot of ne ipas, i had one again recently. there s still something special about it. it s not too sweet, not too bitter, well balanced, full bodied yet crisp. worth the trouble if you can find it fresh."

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"entire bay area gets a limited amount of heady topper once a year. this year it all sells out in 1 hour, because of instagram, except....(drumroll) at whole foods in capitola, which i guessed correctly from it distal location.  finally i get to try it.  yeah!  pours with lightly hazy gold color.  initial bright citrus and piney hop aroma is quite nice and strong, but fades quickly.  very sharp finish: a combination of high citrus hop bitterness, light citric or other acidity, and some mineral character.  some light meaty profile to this, maybe unhealthy yeast, or malt profile.  certainly middle of the road for hazy ipas, but you have to admire the originator of the style.  easish to drink. pretty good."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"0,473 litre can, shared with bergstaden. cloudy golden with white head. malts, hops, citrus, some herbal bitterness."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"(can) hazy burnt orange body with large, stiff white head and lots of lacing. aroma of pine resin, grass, moderately malty, some tropical fruit, peach, notes of orange and grapefruit. medium-plus body, oily texture, round and chewy. flavor is moderately sweet, caramel malty backbone, pine resin and grapefruit bitterness, peach, melon; a bit dank and an earthy quality."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"16 oz can, canned 6/10/20.  pours hazy dark yellow with a medium meringue white head that retains fairly well and leaves a little lacing.

the aroma is fruit with resiny piney hops that are slightly catty.

the flavor is some wheat malt with sugary fruit and a big resiny ashy bitter finish.  the mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.

overall, a nice ne dipa, but not quite the mind blowing experience i was expecting.  too much catty, ashy, dank hops."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can (6/22/20) pour. appearance is deeply hazy light brown-orange-yellow with nice lazy sparkle at the edges of the glass, finger-width foamy white head with decent retention and light lacing. aroma is citrus, candied fruit, herb/vegetal, pine that you kind of need to sit with to get through the various layers. cracker malt backbone. taste is strong pine and citrus, with stone fruit and bitter component dominating the second half. mouthfeel is light side of light-to-medium bodied with smooth, frothy texture, soft carbonation, fair alcohol warmth and finish as taste with strong bitter finish. overall, i can see the bridge between the west coast ipa's and the birth of neipa and this is an important beer. very well crafted as there's good complexity but it doesn't beat you over the head. enjoyable, and i'm glad i've now had it, but given what's being produced these days it doesn't blow me away. a bit thin for the style these days."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hazy rich golden with a thick white head. lovely nose of dank fresh floral resinous hop oils and a touch of grapefruit pith. smells like a summer beer fest. full flavor that s a little soft and pale and wheaty but has a bit of body to it , supporting a fresh floral dank resinous bitterness that s balanced and smooth. really firm and charming and dank."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"pint can. cantaloupe hop aroma with notes of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, orange and some pine resin. pours hazy golden colored with a large off white head that has excellent retention and good, soapy lacing. starts with juicy pineapple, mango and orange flavors. finishes dry, but quite smooth with wonderful cantaloupe, dank grapefruit and pine resiny hop flavors. quite good. definitely lives up to the hype."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"delicious from the can (happy now alchemist?), but also i poured some in a glass to get the full aroma. it was so tasty that i chugged it and now i don't have any left to write this review. aroma was good with lots of hoppy goodness. but mostly i couldn't get over the mouth feel, which seemed to have a perfect hazy thickness to it. i've had other hyped beers that didn't live up to it, but this one does."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,honestly this beer opened up the world of craft for me and introduced me how extreme flavor can really set you on a pursuit of the best beer in the world!
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hype-worthy. big, juicy, resinous hop notes, dripping with grapefruit, orange, lemon zest, and stone fruit, backed up by wood, white pepper, and hints of berry, all slathered with a bitter, piney dose of hop vitriol. subtle grain and honey sweetness creates a sturdy, necessary base. finishes with a mild vanilla tone and endless oily hop goodness. absolutely delicious."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can. very hazy honey color with head that mostly dissipates. strong fresh hop aroma. resiny, piney, fruity hops. maybe its that unpasteurized bit but something hazy this way comes on the nose. strong dense hoppy beer. long bitter hop palate. not a 1000ibu wrecking ball but very long lasting leafy hop snack for later in the mouth kinda drink. im really not into neipas, and this one is from vermont, so either this is the best hazy double ever or this mofo made me turn a corner. it's a deeply hoppy and bitter dipa that definitely had a hand in the boom of the style. great beer."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"16 oz. five weeks old. pours hazy golden-orange with a one+ finger cream-white pillowy head with excellent retention. aroma is cantaloupe, b.o., latex, passionfruit, strawberry laffy taffy. taste has a moderate to high pithy bitterness, light juicy sweetness, with flavors like the aroma. perfect creamy mouthfeel with just right carbonation. slightly better than focal banger. a little less perceived bitterness, too."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"for the style it might be good, but a beer that is like what i imagine would be giving a pine tree a blowjob is not worth the cult hype."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can from k&l in redwood city, ca. aroma is floral / bright hops, fresh grass or tropical plants, some honey. taste is floral sweetness then dry hops... not overly bitter or sweet but leaning into both sides as i sip. some nutty grain on the finish but then the bitterness builds over time (in a good way). tried both in the glass and from the can (as recommended) and honestly did get a more floral hoppy note from the can. very well balanced and nice floral hop and honey, but wasn't blown away (especially based on the hype)."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hazy golden. pine, pineapple, citric, juicy, light malty. fairly bitter finish. excellent."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"appearance: pours hazy medium orange color with a generous lasting frothy creamy white head, with good lacing.
 
5/5

aroma: citrus, grapefruit, papaya, peach, tropical fruits, raisin, caramel and honey, with grassy herbral piney earthy hops and caramel & coffee.
 
8/10

taste: fruity and hoppy piney with unique bitter characters such as chocolate, caramel and coffee. huge sweetness and bitterness, balanced and strengthful palate, finish is hoppy grapefruity herbral bitter with distinct sweet aftertast, lingering.
 
9/10

mouthfeel: mediun to full bodied, moderate carbonated. a bit astringency.
 
4/5

overall
palate outweighs the nose, with all the complex, balance and strength one can expect from an dipa. 
 ipa 
17/20"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,can (1 pint). pours cloudy straw with white head and lacing. fresh hop aroma (tropical fruit with pine). tropical fruit upfront followed by resiny pine. some honey notes in the mid-palate followed by a drying finish. soft mouthfeel. medium body. excellent.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,nose is fruity and a little dank with lots of citrus.  flavor leans hard on hops without a lot of bitterness;  malt balance against juicy hop flavor dominates the palate. finish is medium and slightly acidic. great!
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"light amber/orange color with an off-white head. aromas of tropical fruit, spruce and alfalfa. heavy and resinous. flavors are malty with a heavy dose of fruit and earthy hops. tried from the can and poured, interestingly less dank in the glass, and that wasn't necessarily a bad thing. just not quite my style of brew. i like it but..."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"aroma - from the can - floral, citrus, pineapple. it does not blow you away aromatically though. pouring into a class you get a slightly hazy gold with a fluffy white head. taste is medium bitter, lightly sweet. definitely more of a traditional ipa then some of the hazy/neipas that are coming out these days (even though they are the og). grassy, floral, bitter orange/grapefruit peel. mouthfeel is spot on. obviously a great ipa but there are so many good options in vermont and this doesn't really distinguish itself from the other great ones."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"fat @ mikkeller moriskan malm . hazy orange l with a slight white foam. aroma and taste of peach, grapefruit and spicy bitterness."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"aroma-canned pineapple
view- cloudy, orange, low head
taste- almost belgian-like, mild hops, resin, tarty, piney, and sorta shandy-like"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"pours a golden hazy / opaque color with very little foam. somewhat subtle aromas, resiny pine and citrus. extremely well balanced beer. hops, citrus, juicy oranges, effervescence, tart oily, mangoes, pineapple, grapefruits, kiwi. wow"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"473ml can, poured into a glass like a civilized human being - serving suggestion be damned. maybe it's because i've spent the day drinking the juiciest beers on earth but this....is not a nepa to me. well, i mean, kind of. it's cloudy but not thick and murky like a ""traditional"" nepa. lots of dank hops - citrus and pine, ripe mango, pineapple, floral undertones,  sweet biscuit malt. it's wonderfully, deliciously chewy, very hoppy, and quite bitter (still smooth af). it's also very pretty, and leaves spider-man-like webbing on my glass. as good as it is i think i prefer focal banger - or the sample of rapture i tried at the brewery. this is a great beer, but for my money it's not as good as the insane hype."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,forgot to rate this one after my visit to the brewery in june. really tasty! probably my favorite of those i sampled. really juicy and i can see why this is in such high demand.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"47.3cl can from bierhalle deconinck in victe. u: hazy golden blond with a white head. g: citrus, mandarin, mango and pine. s: sweet with hop bitterness. very fruity (pineapple, mandarin and mango), somewhat grassy and citrus. m: medium body and medium carbonation."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,pours cloudy gold with a fizzy white head. nose is fruity and a little dank with lots of citrus.  flavor leans hard on hops without a lot of bitterness;  malt balance against juicy hop flavor dominates the palate. finish is medium and slightly acidic. great stuff.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can @ home w friends/maltkings. appearance: pours hazy golden with ok white soapy head and lacing. aroma/taste: barley, bread, citrus, grapefruit, marmalade, lots of tropical fruit and grassy notes. palette: strong us hoppy aroma, average carbonation, medium to full body, medium sweetness, balanced by a medium to notable bitterness, average to long duration and a watery texture. overall: great neipa"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"lci. poured from the can. difficult to get a fresh one in europe, but still a pretty good dipa: bitter-sweet, fruity (citrus), hoppy. almost great."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"nice double ipa. 
very bitter as justified by 120 ibu
not my favorite 
smooth mouthfeel.

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hazy yellow pour, small white head. aroma of citrus,  grapefruit, pine and a hint of orange peel. very hoppy flavour followed by a bit of citrus, pine and grapefruit ending in a lasting bitter finish."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"superb color, on the nose powerful notes of hops and citrus fruits. on the palate it is perfectly balanced, it is good, very good. sweet and bitter and refreshing finish. thick body, but not excessive. 
in short, a delight."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"17/05/2019 @home - can from bierhalle deconinck.
hazy straw yellow, nice white head. nose is lots of fruits, bitterness. taste is malts, lots of fruits, floral, bit pepper, bitterness,  high expectations and it lived up to it, maybe even still better. full of taste, lots of bitterness but so easily drinking."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"tap at mbcc. pours orange. aroma and flavor are sweet, bitter, dry, fruity, citrus, grapefruit. overall: very good."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can as gift. thank you so much cam. looks superb. soft, hazy glow to the peachy yellow with a small white head. nose is full of yogurt, stone fruits, soft chews and a light savory hop. on the tasting it's the same but the grassy herb hop sting is far more pronounced bringing quite a dry finish. full bodied with a refreshing level of carbonation. it's one of these neipa beers where the bitterness has not been neglected and it's all the better for it. i've been after it for a long time and i'm not disappointed. for a pioneer beer i can only imagine how this blew people's minds. this is fantastic."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"from a cam to a glass. pours a hazy amber color with a massive frothy creamy silky head. aroma is dank citrusy tropical fruits grapefruit, guava, oranges, pineapple, lemon zest, papaya. taste follows the aroma with a wet green hop note and earthy spices hop note in the sip. medium mouthfeel. outstanding beer!!"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"cloudy and hazy not clear at all. aroma is subtle. piney and smooth, after taste is not over powering. overall worth the praise it s received 

ian"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,had on tap at the mikkeller beer celebration 2019. this was the first beer i had as soon as i got in. the beer poured hazy and light  very easy to drink. no bitterness but not as good as crusher
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can bought from debierkonig, amsterdam, consumed in garden, 11th may 19.  was surprised and lucky to find this there!  pours a cloudy orange.  aroma is malty, thick resinous pine.  taste is bitter, pithy yet sweet, marmalade, pineapple, more bitter kick, drinks very easily, with a bitter citrus linger, intergrated with sweet notes.  not sure what i had in mind, much more bitter than i expected and that's a good thing, it's a great beer, but i'm left wondering how fresh it is, regardless,  great to have finally tasted this one.  focal banger may have the edge for me."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"awesome tropical citrus hop aroma upon crack of the can. after this wonderful exhale is some mild maltiness. taste is a really unique 1-2 punch of sweet and bitter. complex tropical citrus hops upfront that resolve into a dry bitter close. nice malt backbone brings balance. slightly sticky mouthfeel. followed instructions and drank from the can, but had to pour some to get a look. hazy straw gold with a big wet foamy white head. aroma is much much more subdued after being poured. taste is similar in glass vs the can. this beer lives up to its reputation - so drinkable and such great balance of flavor."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"aroma: hoppy. mango, papaya, orange, tamarind.

appearance: hazy orange with small white head.

taste: high bitterness, quite sweet.

palate: medium body, average carbonation.

overall: good neipa. really strong bitterness. how has this style changed from 120 ibu to nearly 0? very good beer."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can at home from mikkeller beer club. pours hazed orange golden with a white head. aroma: moderate malty, grapefruit, peach, caramel, pine needles. taste: light to moderate sweet & moderate to heavy bitter, grapefruit, orange, peach, grass, resin. dry hoppy finish. medium to full body, soft carbonation. lovely"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"golden pour with a thick fluffy head. strong hops and citrus aroma. taste follows the nose with a smooth, yet bitter finish. full bodied. nearly a perfect beer. standard for other dipa's"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"pours heavy on the head. strong sweet hay notes. soft, sweet and...golden raisin with hops? it's soft and cloying and complicated"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"nice face full of citrus with a fruity background. just a hint of funk. hazy pale yellow. thick bright white rocky head. slowly fades to a half inch mattress of foam. thick lacing. wow. starts understated with a hint of malt and some grapefruit and then blooms into a fruit explosion with citrus layered into tropical flavors. full bodied. soft. a hint of warmth. there s a lot going on here. lives up to the hype.

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,what can you say about heady that has not already been said?  my brother introduced me to this beer when the original brew pub was opened (2010?).  i am visiting my brother next month and cannot wait to load up on some heady!!!
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,from 16 ounce can at whole foods! hazy antique gold with massive billowing head. slight fruit in the aroma. flavor is stone pitted fruit and bitter throughout.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"poured from 16 oz. can. 

lightly hazy gold with a 4-finger off-white head and fair lacing. 

bright aroma of citrus and light fruit. 

taste of mango, citrus and light peach. 

medium/full body and medium carbonation. 

a sweet and fruity ipa with a slight bitterness at the finish.  very easy to drink--almost a dessert ipa."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"I don't want to get carried away by the hype and the rarity. It's good, even very good. Prickly, resinous, bitter as you want. One of the best IPAs I've ever drunk in my life, without a doubt."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"18-jan-2019, can @morten,brought by morten t, thx. :-)
hazy dark golden, almost orange with a low, lasting, white head. aroma is fruit, lots of grape fruit. taste is grape fruit, grape fruit peel, kerosene. not a lot of malt profile. bitter. fantastic but today we can get equally good local brews."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"keg @ the alchemist, served through a cask handpull with sparkler! hazed golden yellow with an overly large creamy white head. very creamy, as you'd expect. smooth not massively fruity, seems a little subdued but quite balanced. pretty much what i remember from can, apart from the creamy head and mouthfeel

jan 29 2019: can @ monthly tasting, chez sophie, jan 19. thanks paul for this. highly anticipated by other members of the group. i was a bit underwhelmed by it. no doubt this beer has its place in the history of us craft beer, but in today's climate it didn't hit the high notes for me. light and fluffy, floral, citrus, hop notes seem a little diminished, pale malt coming through. not getting the expected huge hop hit. perhaps a fresher can would see a different rating."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"28th jan 2019. shrewsbury beer exchange group meeting in chez sophie. cheers paolo for bringing a can of this 'famous' beer to the share. golden body, wispy white head. hoppy little number isn't it! citrus leanings throughout and not as bitter as i had expected. i think the west coast ipa's/dipa's seem 'fresher and more initiative' than this so called 'classic' dipa, slightly underwhelmed with this, but still enjoyed the experience of trying for the first time."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"hazy, golden color. tropical fruits, citrus and some pine in the aroma. strong, hoppy bitterness in taste. crisp and juicy, superdrinkable ."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"16 oz can. thanks jyrchi for this can. hhokxxiii. enjoyed on dec 8 2018. 
i was looking for this beer for a long time. here it is. i'm happy!
cloudy orange color with a small white head. 
strong hoppy piney, citrusy and resinous aroma with mild herbal notes. rich and strong aroma. the flavor is caramel maltiness, strong piney, resinous and citrusy hoppiness, moderate bitterness, dry graininess and mild herbal notes. complex. yummy!"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,the thing i don't like about double ipas is the way i feel afterwards. these are way too strong beers for me (too much alcohol in it and perhaps too complex for my sensitive guts). this is something for me to engage in once in a while. that's why it's not that great on my book.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,can from craftshack. i took a fair amount of sips from the can. then eventually poured it into a glass. pours a light slightly hazy yellow. thin white head. scent is hops and grapefruit. taste is very balanced. lots of hops in the finish. very good beer.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"16 oz about 2 yo can.  pours deep golden with tall, long lasting, fluffy white head and lively carbonation.  aroma is of citrusy hops, bready malt and ripe fruit.  body is full and crisp.  herbal, citrusy hops dominate the palate with bready malt and tropical fruit in the background.  finish is long and very hoppy.  i liked the brew this mellow.  fresh one probably would be too hoppy for me."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"served slightly above temp for reason, and taste was very boozy with great citrus overtones, but backbone was good but have have better"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can for a mikkeller beer club:
light, hazy brown amber color. medium foam. hoppy aroma with pine, kiwi and orange peel. hop aromatic flavor with lots of pine needles and tallow da.
v lbalanced and very lightly drunk."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"gift from a friend who went to pick it up on site for his birthday, i tried it as recommended, from the can, which hinders my ability to truly rate the aroma and the appearance, yet the smoothness of this one is remarkable. the alcohol is fabulously integrated with the drink where you can t discern it. i saved this one for christmas, which is quite appropriate for its extremely tasteful blend. great mixology!"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can. color: hazy golden, frothy white head. aroma: fresh hopbitterness, citrus hints. taste: over medium floral and citrus hop. pine and lightly resinous. subtle lime and mango notes. light to moderate sweetness. great bitterness. medium body. average to above average carbonation and at the same time a pretty smooth mouthfeel. long lasting bitter finish. very nice."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"cloudy, yellow colour with a foamy light tan head. light, sweet and fruity aroma. slight hoppy bitterness, well balanced flavours. low medium body and carbonation, smooth mouthfeel."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"orange with a dense head. very hoppy aroma of pine needles, orange, lemon and grape. bitter beginning, but then the sweetness and a bit of alcohol kick in and mellow it a bit out. a grand double ipa."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"from d see.
slightly cloudy orange with white foam.
fruity aroma of orange, malt, grapefruit, resin. 
tastes bitter and s dt. good balance. 
fruity and bitter finish."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can from mikkeller. frothy white head on a goldish yellow body. as your nose tips into the foam, light fruits from intense hop use swell up. floral hops, lychee, thyme, mango, orange juice, pleasant faint diacetyl even. light sweetness, a hint of spicy hops, medium bitterness. slick medium body, carbonation is slightly hard but just right. a toasty, floral hop finish will stay with you for a long time.
so this is it. one of the holy grails of ipas. and what's left to say? this is round, tasty not too sweet or sticky, well made. is it a once in a lifetime experience? i won't dare to say. don't drink too cold. you'll miss the intense fruit pur e."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"aroma is very sweet, strongly mango, grapefruit, lots of sweet tropics, a bit of ""green hops"".

s: mega grapefruit and citrus, also very nice tropics - mainly mango, very nice bitterness, medium high, not too long."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"thanks to p l for sharing the pack. served in ipa glass. unclear golden with a small white head. spotty lasing. aroma of dry hay, hops, citric. taste many layers, junipher, orange juice, grapefruit. quite complex on the palet, and it has a realy good balance betwen hops and malt."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"peach-like esters (alen!)~ citruses, stone & tropical fruits, pine~ clean malt profile~ high hop bitterness with dry finish~ smooth texture."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"dark yellow cloudy with fine white head. orange, mandarin, resinous, malt, caramel. strict bitter in the aftertaste. very tasty."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can. pours a hazy  yellow amber with moderate head. aromas of  tropical fruit, mashed stoned fruit, pineapple and soft malts.   flavours of mashed fruit, pine, pineapple, oranges ( without being really pithy) and more soft malts.  great to try the original after so many hazy knock offs.  it s worth the waiting."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"16oz can courtesy of ky: hazy gold with a fluffy white head. fantastic citrus & pine hop aroma w/ a hint of light malt. flavor is bold hops, mainly citrus (grapefruit), but not ridiculously so. just enough sweet malt comes through to even things out. pretty dry w/ a piney finish that lingers on & on. good level of carbonation. hides it's 8% well, very well crafted downright delicious beer."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can from mikkeller web shop. hazy orange color with an average head. malty, intense citrus fruits, grapefruit, lemon peel, grass, inbetween sweetish, crisp, piney, comes to a bitter end, sparkling, very good."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,obviously a great beer but didn't like it quite as much as i expected to. reminded me more of a west coast ipa

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can that has earned pete a place in heaven. thanks, man! pours a slightly hazy light gold with a dense head of white foam. aromas are lemon, light pine sap, a touch of cat pee, and a little honey biscuit. flavor is most excellent. it's hop driven, but not absurdly so. it's a light ipa (lemon and light malts rather than caramel) and is very nicely put together. things blend very well and it has a great cohesion to it."

The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"mild aromas of citrus and sweeter fruit. taste is medium bitterness with amazing balance considering high gravity. finish is smooth. overall, a little disappointing considering all the fanfare around this beer as nothing particularly special about this, but no real complaints either."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"date: august 30, 2018... occasion: celebrating the first day of my twentieth year in education with a beer whose history is equally worth celebrating... glassware: duvel tulip... pours from a can not three days old, thanks to jeff and his vermont-nj dual citizenship... builds a four-finger, snow white head of thick, bubbly clumps that cling and web down the glass... its body is golden orange, hazy and bubbly, illuminated when light passes through... impressive first impression: a wall of resinous pine, pineapple, melon, orange, and lemon, merging with fragrant musky basement flowers... further, hard fruits of apple and pear swirl with a hearty, lightly toasted malt backbone... at 8%, this sips smoothly, with a lively tooth rattle and a simmering finish that leaves a strong resinous aftertaste... orange peel and grapefruit reign in this deluge of citric storm--a delivery on its promise to maximize its hop experience... something in this is also unique--the air and yeast create the dankness that ups its ante... start to finish, nothing not to like about this beer--big, bold, respectful, flavorful, fresh and hoppy.... this destination beer is indeed worthwhile, and i could only imagine having a few on a nightly basis, which i what this was meant to do, even at its ibus....i am so thankful jeff wrangled this for me...big experience crossed off the beer bucket list!"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"herbs, citrus, pine and cereal in nose. pours golden with white head. taste is medium dry with citrus, cereal and pine. high bitter finish, average carbo. overall very good. on tap at source."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,i use to drive 2hrs from nh to the alchemist brewery to get cases of this by far one of my favorite ipas
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"a lot going on here, so many hop notes my taste buds got confused. a strong iipa, not a session beer, one was enough."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"this is the one that all other dipa s are compared to-floral in excess, hoppy, citrus, sl resinous, minimal malt, oh what a beer..."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"this beer made neiipa's famous. how many 8% cloudy, aromatic, hoppy iipas are there now? they're all made in the mold of heady.
 
aromas off the chart. cloudy golden colour. fruity, sweet, bitter, balanced.

exceptional"
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"oooops. what a disaster. strong alcohol, green stalk, no citrus, but no caramel also."
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,originally rated using the ratebeer application on my phone.  for some reason errors erased my notes and made it a tick.  i no longer have the reference notes.
The Alchemist Heady Topper,3.5,"can (50 cl) provided by and shared with a friend, thx. almost clear golden, medium white head. rich yet restrained tropical fruit hop aromas, some dank notes, and a bit weird earthy component. medium to full bodied, medium carbonation. dry to semi dry, medium to high bitterness. very good, but that strange earthy notes lowers the score a bit."

Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"draft @ flavor. nice unfiltered, slightly hazed look. nice lacing too. smells  ber fresh. the malts especially, pure and straight from the old country. and the crisp inviting grassy hops taste clean and smooth too. excellent lingering grassy finish. nice body. first impressions aren t everything though. after a little while, the aroma gets a little grainy and the hops dont express as fully ss they could. it ends up having some unfinished wood character too and just doesn t hold up well as it warms. however, it s a good effort, is well-constructed, and is better than most americans can manage. the funny thing is, i felt the whole time this was more germanic than czech. it s so damn grassy and clean. my rating changed as i sipped...ending at 4-6-3-6-14 but i was having the sour mash at the same time and that might have interfered."

m - medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. the beer feels super smooth and very crisp. the finish is really clean and very refreshing.

Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"draft @ toronado; crystal clear soft yellow with slight creamy white head; crisp malt, noble hops, a little honey; so damn easy to drink; light mouthfeel with clean, crisp flavor profile; pilsner malt, crackers, lemon, dry hay; lovely stuff indeed"
Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"draft at flavor. hazy gold with generous rocky head and cheerful lace. aroma has yeasty, sulfury components outweighing gentle floral and strawlike scents. flavor is quite restrained for a brian beer; there is some cut grass and whatnot, but the strong carbonation and slightly abrasive minerality are more notable."
Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,on tap toronado sf. clear golden & nice white head. grassy lemony crisp flavors. light body with mellow hops. easy to drink and refreshing. solid pilsner.
Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"my bottom line:

this bohemian-style pilsener displays snazzy saaz over, within and after crisp pils malt crackers, building as authentic a pint of the style you ll find this side of the atlantic.



further personal perceptions:

-a fluffy sheet of foam covers the transparent golden. 

-if the nose had been more engaging (brighter hops), this would have been world-class.

-that spicy saaz zing creates wonderful bitterness.

-the overall flavour profile is balanced.  

-drinkability is optimal, even if one is used to lighter-bodied german examples.



on tap at flavor."
Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"very pale straw colour.  the nose is really lovely.  herbal, zesty and juicy with a loads of fresh hoppy character.  bright grassy/lemony nose over a fresh straw-like maltiness.  a touch of grassy character toward the back.  softly bready/crackery malt with a long lingering hop finish.  lovely pils."
Moonlight Reality Czeck,3.4,"easily the best pilsener that i ve had so far. reality czeck is an excellent beer. the beer is golden in color with a white head that leaves decent lacing. the aroma is very cleanly hoppy and crisp with freshness. there is some excellent pale malt balancing things out. the beer has wonderful grain flavors. there are light hop notes, mostly pine and grass, with a slightly bitter finish of lemons. the malt and grain flavors are just right and so much better than cheap lagers that it s like night and day. you taste the fresh grains that go into this beer, and they re crisp and bready. the mouthfeel is smooth and crisp. it s a very easy beer to drink."

foam: book foam. awesome. tall, lush, fluffy. ob dny lacing and lasts at .  5/5

smell: smells exceptional. lots of spice character of bourbon barrel: nutmeg, vanilla, black pepper. lots of oxidation elements: plum, cherry in chocolate, a bit of honey, toffee and caramel. strong, multidimensional, barrel character.

taste: moderately sweet drink. bourbon barrel in the climate of oak, rotten wood. in addition nutmeg, chocolate, coffee and caramel. I admit that the aroma is much more complex, as the taste. here more spice notes, more dryness and warming alcohol.
oak, dark chocolate and dark cocoa in the attack. a bit lacking balance.

carbonation:

it's been known for a long time that I like sweet, full-bodied dark beers. the aroma is exactly what it promises. vanilla, powerful bourbon, plum and cherry in chocolate. nutmeg, toffee and caramel. the taste is centered: oak, wood, cocoa, spices and coffee. p full, a little spicy and slightly roasted on the finish. the alcohol warms.

Fremont B-Bomb,4.1,"It's been a long time dream of mine to get a wax-coated fremont pot, and this year it came true. due to the proper sequence, my choice fell on a full version of the worn miracles - because of the particularly armful atmosphere and they don't really push themselves in the chamber, because the daily series opens with this, its not I try to lull myself into a good mood with a very special journal. the aromas of so many barrels and alcohols, rum and bourbon show a thousand faces, cock, stone, chocolate, marzipan, leather aromas lace the air. the sips are smooth, and with time they become smoother, as if they are made of wood, they carry the characteristics of chocolate, cognac cherry piquant fruit on the basis of velvety vanilla, kaka powder. It is blessed with a masculine bitterness, and it is even more refined, it gives the impression of a stable, upper-class body. the consumption served me very well, my long-standing desire for alcohol was fulfilled, my skepticism about weak and rare alcohols was remedied six times by the noble bottle of the Seattle distillery."

Fremont B-Bomb,4.1,"22 ounce bottle

on the 2013 bottle this is listed as ""bourbon abominable winter ale"". inside it seems to pack the same punch as newer vintages. whether you save it for a cold winter evening or dig it out after a few years of aging the impact is a heady experience that should be excellent for at least a couple of years.

aroma / appearance
a fluid black base clings to the sides of the glass with a persistent and stubborn effort. chocolate, malt balls, sweet vanilla, and warm coffee darken the air with a boozy haze.

flavor / palate
chocolates, raspberry, vanilla, and a multitude of dense background flavors immediately cling to the palate. the dense mouthfeel works to a boozy finish that leaves a smoky trail in the throat. the rich experience would work well with a dessert in most circumstances. i wouldn't sit on it much more than four years but it definitely is not one to pop open right away if you do not wish."

2015 vintage @ 14,0% abv

deep dark brown coloured body with a lightly opaque brown glow and a thinnish, one to perhaps two centimetre tall tan head. aroma of bourbon, vanilla, brown sugars, molasses, canella, oak, sesame leaves, grain and toasted cashews - nice and incredibly aromatic, especially the bourbon and vanilla notes. full-bodied; incredibly rich and robust, yet entirely smooth and subdued, somehow. strong anise and licorice notes at first with a bunch of vanilla, bourbon, oak, grain, lactose and even some light cherry flavours manage to find their way out. aftertaste is remarkably rich and complex with vanilla, oak, grain, alcohol (it has to be around somewhere at 14%, but hits nicely, actually) along with caramelised sugars, some toffee and a dose of light mushrooms at the tail end. overall, a very nice and incredibly well-aged beer with a ton of flavour, not much of an alcohol kick, hardly any astringency or pungency but a lot of complexity and a wide array of flavours - great to sample! i almost with i kept this for another few years, but i think at about right now it hit it's stride just perfectly - tons of complexity without any perceived bitterness, astringency or alcohol wallop - especially at 14%, this feels more like 9,0%! i sampled this 65 cl, wax-sealed bottle purchased from pear delicatessen in seattle, washington [state] on 18-february-2018 for us$16,20 sampled at home in [the real] washington on the opposite coast on 09-april-2018, just after two years of keeping this in the cellar, but three years after vintage.

deep inky black with a rusty orange head. the 2017 vintage is still boozy but toasty dark chocolate. the medium body gives dark chocolate wafers coated in bourbon and maple syrup. great stuff but boozily young. give it another year to mellow out.

smell. delicately sweet aroma, surprising the cleanliness and elegance with which it presents itself to my nose. notes of caramel, chocolate brownie biscuit, marshmallow, toasted nuances of barley and coffee, light caresses of vanilla and coconut, bourbon. 
taste. a sweet wave caresses the palate, in the middle light toasting, slightly bitter finish and with a subtle carbonation before the characteristic oak notes of bourbon. in the aftertaste all the initial sweetness returns to close the circle of this dessert drink where the olfactory sensations are fully respected. 
body. medium-high viscosity, roundness and softness. well hidden abv. 
the added elements, coffee, cocoa, marshmallow work in harmony and do not overdo it, it must be said that the bottle I am drinking is 2 years old. the work of the barrels is also very elegant."

Bottle Logic Scatter Signal,4.2,had a 3 year vertical of this and they were all solid. not too sweet or too much coffee. tasty beverage.
Bottle Logic Scatter Signal,4.2,"tip tap draught, 5/21/23.
dark, inky, fairly viscous. small, tan head, low retention.
nose is interesting at first, while the beer is cold. you do get quite a bit of marshmallow and coffee with less bourbon than i'd like. lots of fudgey, chocolatey malts, though a good helping of balancing acidity. coffee, dark chocolate and crunchy, earthy, nutty cacao.  no booze.
the flavor is initially somewhat sweet, lots of fudge with a coffee flavor featuring good acidity and nutty cacao. but as it warms and breathes, it softens both the sweetness and acidity somehow. chocolatey, with vanilla, lighter bourbon than i'd like but still enough acidity and dryness. no alcohol.  it's riding a thin line of being too sweet but never gets too sweet.  in fact, i ordered a second glass and it was still delicious and mostly balanced.  i would like more bourbon, but the coffee and cacao are well-done. this would probably be a mid 4s if not for the marshmallow, which is too sweet and...marshmallowy."

Bottle Logic Scatter Signal,4.2,"purchased at states street liquor from redlands, california for $28.72, scatter signal is an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels and finished with coffee, cacao nibs, and marshmallows brewed by bottle logic brewing from anaheim, california.

the smell of dark chocolate, mocha, marshmallows, and bourbon are noted as you drink. the appearance is pitch black that pours a low brown head. when held up to light, no light shines through. dark brown shows when light reflects off the beer. the alcohol content is 14.8%.

dark chocolate gently bitters the take and flavors the complexion. roasted malt deepens the chocolate feel and fairly weighs the drink. cacao nibs slightly bitters the take and provides a nuttiness to the dark chocolate and roasted malt composition. mocha assists with the bitter take and relatively textures the mouthfeel.

bourbon fairly boozes the drink and imbues a caramel hue to the frame. marshmallows silkens the take, blends with the bourbon, and prominent to the slightly dry finish. biscuit malt compliments the cacao nib and marshmallow blend. oak imbues a woodsy touch to the marshmallow and bourbon solution.

scatter signal is a voluptuous barrel aged imperial stout. dark chocolate, roasted malt, cacao nibs, mocha, bourbon, marshmallows, biscuit malt, and oak merge into a delectable craft beer. dark chocolate, roasted and biscuit malts, marshmallow, and bourbon body are accented by cacao nibs and mocha. dark chocolate and marshmallows eases the drink, where mocha reverberates upon. as the beer warms, the alcohol content fairly burns the slightly dry finish, which harmonizes with the cacao nib, mocha, and oak elements. the star feature is the mocha coffee, which is sensible upon each aspect of this libation. i treasured each drink and mesmerized by the complexity and depth of this brew. 

cheers. prost. drink for the love of beer.

Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"a 12 oz bottle found at the local beer shop, i always thought a marzen could benefit from barrel aging and a higher abv. in my buffalo bayou snifter, i see a clear amber completed by a skim of tan-silver foam. the scent is mostly your basic oktoberfest nose with earth, some caramel and a slice of bread. the drink is a a significant improvement beyond the smell. strong caramel, baked wheat bread, a touch of booziness and candy. the beer registers a bit thinner than anticipated, could have been a home run otherwise. nice beer, maybe the beer that stands out from any other in the style. but it could have been something extraordinary along the lines of founders dkml which was life changing."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"12 oz bottle rating.  very typical oktoberfest colors of reddish brown in color with legs and a thin white head.  notes of caramel, bread, cereal grains, brown sugar and bourbon.  flavor is more of the same, the barrel character on this is nice, well integrated, and not overdone."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"bottle. pours a reddish golden with a frothy, off-white head. aromas of bourbon and grain. low carbonation. upfront notes of bourbon followed by breadiness, grain, and caramel malt. a bit of candied fruit. finishes sweet with a sturdy presence of earthy hops that lingers. slight booziness. slightly peppery on the tongue. very drinkable."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"this is an astonishingly tasty brew from founders. it goes down easy and hardly reveals its 10% abv... fortunately i am able to buy one at a time at coopers corner in florence, ma."

Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"bought at founders brewing in grand rapids, michigan. 12 ounce bottle at the house in stow, ohio. smell malt and bourbon. bronze in color with white head. taste the malt, bourbon, and slight sweetness. little bit boozy. complex. bourbon lingers in the aftertaste. wonderful beer for a cold winter night. cheers!"
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"sweet and strong, but still a dangerously smooth sipper. rich malts, and complex on the palate.  caramel and a little fresh pine. good."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"pours clear orange-amber with a 2-finger off-white head.  caramel-bourbon aroma with a note of wood beneath.  full-bodied and a touch on the syrupy side.  the finish is long, with a mild boozy astringency.  sweet bourbon flavor that is cut by the barrel wood.  as it warms, a bit of the stereotypical grain notes show."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"taste: bready, malty sweet, spicy bourbon, oak, robust finish. ferment barley malt, bread nose. dark amber/copper hue. clear, with delicate head and fingered lace of barrel aged beers. medium/full body. smooth."

Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"perhaps the ultimate malt bomb, caramel and molasses and more caramel, with a slight smokiness on the back end and whiskey and baking spices on the finish. over the top, but i can t think of a better beer to wrap up oktoberfest season."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"clear copper pour with a white soapy head that dissipates quickly.  aroma of vanilla, bourbon, and some fig.  vanilla and bourbon dominate the flavor with notes of caramel, fig, and toasted malt."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"been wanting to try this brew. ruby chestnut colored. nose is all vanilla bourbon. tatses of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, leafs, wood. silky palate."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"@024 - maintains the mouthfeel of a regular o'fest, but tastes like a o'fest and bourbon boilermaker. the abv would make it an imperial, but weight remains light. really nice variant for the season."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"i rated this is september and december 2022. this is a composite review. 12-ounce bottle pours clear copper-auburn with a tiny off-creamy beige head and lacing. aroma: brown sugar, dark dried pitted fruits, caramel, sweet cherries. flavor: caramel, brown sugar, toffee, oak, coconut, candied plums, figs, dates, vanilla, pecan butter, anejo amber-colored rum, sipping bourbon. mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied and and oily finish and a boozy warmth at the close. an excellent sipper."

Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"bottle to snifter, shared with the mrs. pours a mostly transparent deep orange with bubbly off-white head that steadily dissipates into lacing. smells as the description suggests: like a monster marzen with big notes of oak and vanilla followed by a hint of bourbon. tastes like it smells with a bit of hops as well. mouthfeel is medium full-bodied and very mildly bitter & warming. an enjoyable high-octane take on the style."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,silky smooth style as it should be even barrelaged with a small bite to it. drinkable slightly more complex with bourbon counterbalance against the sweetness very good beer would like to taste on tap
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"12 oz bottle.  pours a clear amber with a slightly off-white head.  appley aroma with bourbon and brown sugar.  flavor of brown sugar and bourbon, on a honeylike pale malt.  it's basically what i'd expect for a bourbon barrel imperial m rzen, but that means it's not terribly exciting, unfortunately."
Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"clear, deep, copper-red pour with a white head.  the aroma is pretty mild with touches of wood.  it has a full body with smooth texture.  the taste is sweet but well rounded with a warm bourbon finish."

Founders Ultimate Oktoberfest,4.2,"from a 12 oz. bottle dated 7-25-22.  the pour is a handsome looking copper-amber under a modest tan colored head.  good clarity.  the aroma is especially malt forward, brown bread, vanilla. cream, and crackery.  little to no hop presence. and i do not get a woody aged sensation that i thought i might.  the body is light-medium. the taste is sweet and malty with those same vanilla characters.  it is very nice."

aroma:  moderate scents of malt, brown sugar, and caramel which is then followed by subtle hints of lemon.  the scent-level was a little lower than i would have preferred, even after it had warmed to (almost) room temperature.

appearance:  pours a clear golden copper color with a 2-finger, white, medium-frothy head, that dissipates somewhat slowly with moderate lacing.  i would have preferred the head to last a little longer, but it stayed around long enough that i'm not going to gripe about it.  with a full head, the bear looks incredibly inviting.  without the head it looks like a glass of iced tea, sans ice.

taste:  i'm first hit with moderate sweetness and light flavors of malt, caramel, and honey.  which is then followed by light sourness and finishes with a hint of toasted biscuit.  for me, i wish there was just a touch more sweetness and that the malt and caramel flavors were amplified a bit more.  as it is, i find the flavor a bit flat, but not totally lacking.

mouthfeel:  the body is right on the edge of the thin/medium bodied border, with a somewhat smooth texture and below average carbonation.

overall:  i have tried a handful of other beers from founders, and i have to say that this is the ""worst"" that i've had.  that doesn't mean that this is a bad beer (it's not), just that it doesn't seem to match the high-quality level of their other beers.

would i buy this again?  maybe not, but only because there are other m rzen beers that i've tried that i like better, and are readily available.  am i unhappy that i bought a 12-pack?  absolutely not.  i enjoy trying new beers and, in this case, i found it to be a nice beer that has a nice flavor.  its only fault is that it just didn't beat out other beers that i've tried.  granted, you may not want to go ""all in"" on a 12-pack, like i did, but if you are a true beer adventurer then i would certainly urge you to at least try a single ... you won't regret it.  now if you'll excuse me, i think i'm going to go and crack open another one."

""drink responsibly. they don't serve founders in the clink, yet.""  goes down easy.  a nice diversion from the ubiquitous hazy ipa, lo-cal ipa, juicy mcdanknuts ipa, etc. ipa my local liquor store offers. almost got the o'fallons dad's scotch candy toffee yadi yada stout, but this looked better. glad i picked it up.  come on bock season, take me away!"

Founders Oktoberfest,3.6,"on tap at brook's kitchen & tap in oakbrook terrace, il. dispensed to a flight glass showing a clear, amber hue, a decent layer of soft white froth that reduced to a ring & light film, with spots & streaks of lacing. the nose was pleasantly malty & toasted, with a touch of caramel sweetness. a bit less than medium bodied, with good carbonation, the taste was as the aroma, finishing with slight hop astringency. a fairly tasty, no bells & whistles rendition of the style."

Founders Oktoberfest,3.6,"had this on tap at jamesport brewery.  they have a guest tap that recently has featured founders stuff and this is great - gives me a chance to catch founders' seasonals from far away.  this one wasn't that impressive, dark and funky, with a significant clash (rather than a balance) between malt and hops.  both are strongly present, but their controversy (which i'd say the malt wins) leaves a kind of unclean sensation, the residue of a battlefield you might say."
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"12 ounce bottle. vintage xxvi; 11.8% abv. roasted malt aroma has oak and whiskey notes. flavor follows nose. sweet roasted malt. warming alcohol. woody, bourbon notes. hints of molasses, chocolate and vanilla. well done."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"from beerrepublic.eu. in a teku glass. with pistachios. playing hogwarts legacy. just the profile of aging in bourbon barrels that I love, with the wood notes very well adjusted to be delicious"
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"described as xxv. black with creamy head. aroma has wood, vanilla, bourbon. bittersweet taste. more like coffee in the beginning but it sweetens up with the bourbon coming through stronger and stronger. would benefit from being slightly thicker and having zero carbonation instead of the fine bubbles it has. still excellent though."
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"12 oz. bottle, xxv variant. label states it is 11.2% alcohol (not ounces). muddy, black pour with a thick brown crown of foam. little to no carbonation. the drink appears perfectly motionless as the foam dissipates. massive aromatics of double chocolate cake, chocolate mousse and dark roast coffee. further notes of caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup and molasses alert the senses that a big dessert beer draws nearer to your lips.

the bourbon flavors are immediately noticeable upon first sip. flavors continue with the decadent dessert motif in mind. it has a massive sweetness but at the back of the palate is an ashy char keeping things in proper bittersweet balance. roasted barley is amped up and acts as a dam against the crush of chocolate, caramel and coffee that tries to burst through and drown you in sweet seduction.

as sipping leads to gulping, it brings with it waves of alcohol heat, which lingers in a long, dry finish. this one is very boozy and delivers a quick buzz. over 11% a/bv is well concealed, all things considered. it s even bigger and sweeter than base old rasputin, with the bba addition imparting flavors of oak and raisin. what you re savoring is indeed a rare treat, highly coveted and maybe untameable. this is one of the most chocolatey beers i can recall tasting. it s also chock full of coffee bean aroma and taste. as the beer warmed up a bit, dark fruit characteristics of raisin, fig and prune began to emerge and mellow.

as you might have guessed, the beer is full bodied with a syrupy texture. from its initial delectable aromas, to its midnight appearance, decadent flavor and thick mouthfeel, xxv checks all the boxes.

as far as russian imperial stouts go, base old rasputin is one of the better ones. amping it up even further with bourbon barrel aging and added alcohol content serve to push a great beer to extremes, in the best way possible. old rasputin xxv is highly recommended to stout lovers as an excellent dessert beer."
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"xxv version (2023) pours an almost black with moderate brown head that morphs to a cream colored rivulet.  enticing bottle nose of dark fruit, cherry, a bit of candy.  in the snifter nose moderates to bread, malts while simultaneously retaining the dark fruit theme.  boozy.  medium body, sharp twang.  it is definitely the ris bba heavy weight zone with molasses, tobacco, candy, esters, umami.  there is a dusky floral element which i can't identify. there is also an acrid ash and char that lingers on the palate.  a bit harsh, needs refinement.  could use some aging in the bottle.  complex flavor profile.  was a bit disappointed."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"from a vintage xx corked, caged 750 ml. bottle.  the appearance is a gorgeous looking dark brown to jet black color underneath a foamy and fading tan head. becomes a tan ring. aroma of dark chocolate malts, sweet malts, roast, black cherry, char, wood, and alcohol. smooth, almost creamy but full bodied texture.  the taste is sweet with a better offering of dark roasted malts, caramel, and a lower alcohol bite than on the nose. warming. cleansing in a way. i am surprised i had noted rated this until now.  i paid $22 for it and while it is excellent, it is not something i will buy regularly."
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,old rasputin imperial stout is my favorite beer. and i am thinking  don t mess with my favorite beer .  but you messed with my favorite beer. bourbon is not my favorite whiskey. when you mix the two my favorite beer is the loser.
North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"bottle (xvii vintage) - long story short, i've had my eye on this beer for years, but the price was always the obstacle...  until tonight.  nose is dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, light nuttiness, and leather.  sip adds more nuttiness and booze.  smooth but a tad harsh at the same time.  smoother with every sip if not flat out mellow.  this is going down too quickly..."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"old rasputin, one of the great classics in the field of american imperial stout from the earlier days of u.s. craft brewing, aged on bourbon barrels: this one i had to taste.  thanks to craftmember for scoring   and sharing   this bottle!  thick and frothy, shred-lacing, yellowish-beige, stable head on a black beer with glowing  bordeaux  edges.  aroma of lots of vanilla-like oak wood, wooden furniture even,  fondant  chocolate, coconut flakes, old raisins, brazil nuts, furniture wax, sweet bourbon, toffee, latt  macchiato, chestnuts, hazelnut paste, mocha, nougat.  dried figs and old raisins at first, sweet but in a refined and non-cloying way with a faint dried porcini-like umami edge, refined and small-bubbled in carbonation, smooth and vinous, full mouthfeel   though far removed from the excessive viscosity found in many imperial stouts of younger descent; black-chocolatey, pecan- and walnutty malt core, layered and tasty with a soft toasty bitter edge   remaining more sweet than bitter even when this cappuccino-ish roasty touch sets in.  the roasted bitterness stays on the soft side, instead the necessary balance against the sweetness comes from the barrel treatment here, bringing a lot of vanilla-scenting, tannic oakinness, accompanied by a deeply situated, yet important peppery hop bitterness.  this is truly high class drinking, a beverage from a more civilized era i would almost say   or at least from an era when refinement, balance and elegance were more common in imperial stouts than boastful syrupiness and sticky sweetness.  i absolutely love a solid old school stout like old rasputin and this barrel aged variant is indeed even an improvement of the legendary original."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"xxi. unorigined and probably picked up on one of the  17 trips. almost black with a frothy to creamy, beige head that lingers. big licorice aroma with vanilla and bourbon underneath. taste is bittersweet with a big bourbon bite at the end. a touch to the raw and rough side, but not unpleasant. full-bodied, moderate to mild carbonation. a solid if unspectacular example of the style."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"pours medium brown and almost syrupy thick.  good size frothy head made of lots of medium sized bubbles and a nice mocha color.  aroma of sour cherries and brown sugar.  not as malty smelling as i would have guessed but a good aroma nonetheless.  super smooth in the mouth and not too thick at all.  the flavor has a lot of depth.  smooth and even somewhat light on the front, followed by a building malty and sweet body with just enough bourbon to cut the flavor a bit and give it some bite.  this is a darn good beer.  i think one of the most impressive aspects of this beer is that it can be super high abv and have a lot of flavor but still be pretty light and crisp in the mouth.  nicely done."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"burgundy foam body, deep brown body, light with thin stripes, dark, fragrant woody aroma, silky texture, small les, more intense carbonic acid content than usual, n poly, rum chocolate, arabica and notes.  to sum up, this drink is about something like that, which although we wouldn't call it breast milk, I enjoyed the drink a little bit more. because you can make out the alcohol and its effect very well, the bourbon made it a little lighter, made the bottle more lively, while the carbonic acid's bigger eyes made the structure even more light, which suddenly covered the airy buds that are used to mechanical wines. however, the taste of the malt course can be ignored, the notes are in the right place, the low intensity red tone, the high degree of deep g is the only thing that guides my fingers towards the downward dot."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"bourbon barrel aged old rasputin is that rare imperial stout that features a lot of wood character from its aging and has lots of burnt malt bitterness without being overwhelming. this brew pours midnight black. you can see the viscosity before you feel it - pour is slow and heavy. whiskey, roasted malt, and charred sugar aromas. everything about the flavor points at intensity which makes it gratifying when you actually see how smooth this is. the malt is so black and heavily roasty that the taste is just shy of ashy. there's lots of oak character, but that char is is mellowed by the underlying nuances of vanilla, caramel, and syrup. thick and warm feel. you'll certainly notice some mildly astringent alcohol. this was the ideal selection before going out into a snowy night with temperatures in the single digits. it was good to sip this before going back to the cold."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"shared alone, selfishly and without any remorse. i watch, admiring, this noble liquid pass from the bottle to my american solera balloon. it is marvelous. first of all the bottle itself commands respect. the liquid that comes out is not black. it is very brown - or even rather clear, translucent, old. halfway between an old ale and a caribbean rum. the foam that forms in my glass is abundant and adds an additional layer to this harmonious whole. aromas of a warm alcohol from the south of the united states, molasses, jamacan coffee, icing sugar, a barrel that has been hot under the sun. in the mouth i would have preferred a liquid with a more generous and ample body. the liquid is very tight and very thin, a little too much for my palate which wanted to play it more comfortably. a lot of alcohol on the palate. my lips stick together. the 12% alcohol is very poorly concealed, but perhaps the brewer had no desire to conceal anything and that's just as well because it's good! very good even. a good dose of alcoholic coffee ending on a long, half-sweet, half-bitter finish. north coast brewing once again brings me great satisfaction."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"xi anniversary bottle, drunk 10/16/16.
still nicely carbonated, with a tan head, medium in size, well-retained atop a deep ebony with dark mahogany highlights and good clarity.
lovely mix of fruity, vinous notes and dark chocolate, with light fudgey malts to balance. just a hint of oxidation, but it s pleasant and not papery/bready. alcohol very well-concealed, with very even toned aromas that come with extended barrel-aging and conditioning. french roast coffee, plums, prunes and soft caramel all in the mix, with lots of baker s chocolate lingering, but not to the point of overdryness/astringency.
silky, well-attenuated, medium-full body still retains low but tight carbonation. prunes, plums and raisins combine with the dark chocolate and coffee notes to create plentiful bitterness and dryness but the caramel notes and base malts balance quite well. bourbon is artfully expressed, being neither too overdone, nor heavily oaky/toasty. spice, wood, light liquor all deepen complexity without dominating. alcohol shows light warmth, as is inevitable at this strength, but it s quite elegant for its size."

North Coast Old Rasputin (Bourbon Barrel),4.1,"this is a bottle several years old, from whatever vintage was 11.9 percent. the pour is quiet and still, with the finest of bubbles gathering a sheet of mocha foam over the black. the aroma is heated and forceful at first, with pomegranate molasses and milk chocolate treading faithfully against the rising pool of bourbon inflected sweetness; coconut, vanilla, burnt honey. with warmth and aeration, layers of concentrated coffee bean, leather, and roasted berries are revealed.



the taste initially leans with some frailty on the barrel sweetnesses. it is thereafter quickly apparent that the malt foundation has substantially eroded, as flavors of dry wood and old milk chocolate candy bars attest.  it has a thinness, a papery, oxidative, hollow quality.  reliably, the wild, tannic, complex fruit notes of the aroma emerge to provide some intrigue later on. but ultimately, the barrel influence is overwhelming given how the overall structure has weakened. 



the velvety palate envelops many of these issues to some degree. the finish is of wet wood, a port like sweetness of reduced figs. because of its textural sensuality, the lacking, unbalanced or hotheaded tendencies elsewhere can t define the final impression. really, it s hard to say when this beer s ideal moment might have been. it was surely a bomb of overdone barrel aging when young, given that that influence is so intense even at this advanced age. so it s hard to know if it ever might have had a peak moment when the malt foundation was whole and when the barrel influence had at least begun to settle. this is not that moment, but it is still appreciable."

what i like is that the flavours of bourbon is just lurking at the back of tongue, doesn't take the lead as have been the case i many other barrel aged beers i tried.

i did this as a comparison with the ten fidy imperial stout poured simultaneously at same degree. the main difference is that the original is a bit more roasty while the bourbon barrel aged has more complexity. 

both are top notch and what you prefer is just a matter of personal preferences."

Oskar Blues Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.4,"foam: brown, thick, finely bubbled. nicely coats the glass, stays until the end.

colour: black, opaque, uniform, and one could say pearly :-)
aroma: there is whisky, dark chocolate, a touch of barrel, after warming it comes out a little alcohol but more liqueur-like than spirit-like.
taste: intense bitterness covered with sweetness, barrel is confirmed by aroma. you can feel the strength of the beer, it warms strongly, you can feel the alcohol slightly on the edges of the tongue - slight burning, which could be better hidden but I don't know if it is possible at 12.9%. a lot of body, gives the impression of being thick.
aftertaste: slight sourness of combustible salts from the wine, coffee and the impression of eating a Wedel barrel.
very good position but the price, oh well ... you can't have everything ;-)"

Oskar Blues Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,4.4,"Rooster, milky, chocolatey aromas are hidden in the jet-black, espresso-colored body, on which a pleasant light opening, brown-colored foam settles, so that the taste of the wine is not too great. its scent makes it confident, it carries a drop of foreboding, a splash of honey with a black malt base, with a hint of fear, fire, woodiness and authority.  However, according to Rz, unfortunately, there is the case when the zvilg is not specifically the heart of the aromas, because its structure is small, it is full of fried, milky, caramel, chocolate, cheese, etc. It's an exciting mix, I don't feel fulfilled yet; the vanilla and bourbon elements just seem to hang around, they don't boil together with the base of the pot, they don't raise the drink to a new level at all. of course, imperial stout shines, but for now, because in the final campaign, somehow more is needed, a mass of well-loved sron l."

Allagash White,4.0,"ar: dulled nutmeg; earthy, pungently citrus zesty; clean, lightly soured malt. ap: hazy yellow-white; medium-large white head with good retention, slowly receding into a medium cap of bumpy solid foam. t: overripe banana and bruising peaches; lightly sweet; wheat crackers; gracefully dried orange; bitterness is medium-high and fairly rough, with an earthy character; lemony finish. p: medium-light body with high, lush carbonation; finish is very dry. o: for a wit, very assertive--deep fruit notes and somehow punchy austere spices; mouthfeel is really nice; fresh and lush maltiness."
Allagash White,4.0,"as soon as i poured this one, i had a feeling that it would be mild and not that great. the appearance was very thin, a pale yellow. since it was a belgian white with ""spices"", i was expecting a bit more flavor.....which was actually smooth and tasty, just wish there was more of it. sort of like a mild thinner version of blue moon. this could be a decent daytime, lawnmower, or beach beer though."
Allagash White,4.0,"on tap at olive ridley's taphouse and grill in plattsburgh, new york. pours very milkly yellow with thick white head and lacing. aroma: yeasty bread, spice, honey. flavor: yeast, coriander, orange, banana, clove, blueberry, honey. mouthfeel: light-bodied."

flowery slightly spicy aroma, like a belgian blonde. a little bit of rubber in there too.
flavor is flowery, slightly herbal, slightly yellow fruity, again, like a belgian blonde, does havee a bit of wheat in it, but it is not very prominent. taste is quite good, i like it if i had expected a blonde, but if i had expected a witbeer i would be disappointed due to the lack of wheat and citrus. there is a little bit of banana, but that i would more expect from a weissbier."

Allagash White,4.0,this is really good beer if you like belgian whites. try it and see why it beats even the belgian whites for a belgian-style white beer. excellent. this is one of my overall favorite beers. my wife loves it too. brewed in portland maine with water right out of pristine sebago lake.
Allagash White,4.0,"bottle @ home. hazy pale yellow colour with a huge white head. smells and tastes pretty much like a witbier should taste. i m glad there s not a coriander overkill. thin to medium body and really low carbo. still not my favorite type of beer, but i can enjoy this one."

Allagash White,4.0,"from jun 2008

i got this bottle from jwc215. thanks joe!

it pours a coudy lemon yellow with a 2 finger head of foam. good lacing and very good head retention.

the smell is yeasty and has big notes of orange and spice, mainly coriander. a touch of banana as well. great nose for the style.

the taste is of lemon, coriander, a touch of clove, banana, pepper, ok. it fits the style to a t for me and i'm loving it.

medium bodied and well carbonated, it finishes with a lemon zest flavour. very drinkable and seeing how it's only 5%abv, i wouldn't get into too much trouble drinking a few of these.

oh, and i just noticed a sweetness in my last sip....perhaps candy sugar? wow. this is good.

bottom line: a *great* witbier that would make one hell of a return to beer in the upcoming summer. i wish we had it in casper!!"
Allagash White,4.0,"i rate allagash white on a sliding scale comparatively to marten's witte. marten's witte is my high water mark when it comes to belgian whites. it's the best i've ever tasted. although, i don't know if it's the brewing process or not i.e. abv, but i taste candy notes on the head and distilled birch bark thrown in on the aftertaste. allagash white is a domestic offering that needs to step it up to european standards. this american white needs to more closely match a witte from europe, i.e. more candy notes and it will hit the nail on the head. all together it is an 8 where marten's witte is a 10. in an country where it is ever so hard to obtain european imports allagash white should adjust it's offering to brew a true european witte domestically without having to import anything."
Allagash White,4.0,"draft.  hazy yellow color with a short white head.  aroma and flavors are lemon, wheat, coriander.  pretty light and drinkable."
Allagash White,4.0,"finally getting a rating submitted for this classic witbier from allagash - from a bottle-conditioned bottle, this pours a perfect fresh and foamy appearance, solid creamy half-inch of foam that did not dissipate at all thanks to persistent lacing. hazy but translucent pale yellow appearance, soft aroma of wheaty grain and some mild clove and other belgian spices. likewise soft and light-bodied on the palate, nice natural carbonation with a subtly bitter floral hop aftertaste. flavor is a true-to-style unsweet wheat and pale malt with hints of yeast and herbal spices. clean-finishing, easy-drinking, lives up to its reputation."
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"16oz can pours a thick, pulpy orange with two big fingers of white head.  this just smells like good beer.  big grape jelly and gooseberry nose, melon, herbs, perfume.  flavor has malt and oats and wheat, then orange and gooseberry and mango and grape.  nice.  real nice.  medium full bodied, just off dry.  very nicely made and crazy drinkable."
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"8/5/24 - albany, ny - on tap at city beer hall. slight fogginess to the light golden pour, frothy snow-white head. aromatic hoppy aroma, wish i could find a better descriptor than cat urine. juicy, tropical flavor, papaya, mango and tangerine. stick, rich sticky mouthfeel. this brewery has yet to disappoint."

Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"shared draft with steve at armsby abbey. opaque dark yellow with nice head, excellent retention and nice lacing. aroma is strong dank herbal with perhaps slight grape. taste follows aroma. smooth texture soft carbonation and dry finish as taste with light bitterness. strong but not complex and the  danky  iteration of nelson versus the more  grapey  version. well made but not super enjoyable."

note:  late july/early august batch was exceptional - adjusted upwards."
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"can from brewery.  moderate-lightly cloudy apricot juice, with an inch of white head, medium-fine, medium-good retention.  aroma is some dank  big mango (ripe), some onion top, pineapple, bit of melon (cantaloupe) - not as much as i've previously had w/ nelson, touch of passion fruit, and it's hard to discern the white wine grape underneath these dank tropical fruits.  bit of red berry.  body is medium-weight, starchy (textured) and oily, moderate-moderate-light carbonation, and burn.  medium-coarse bubbles.  flavor is some dried mango, bit of orange, some cantaloupe, touch of dank herb, hint of chalk, blackberry.  some bitter grass with a hint of sap on the finish.  really cool ipa!  texture is not quite as cool as other hf ipa's i'm having here, though."

Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"a blond, orange, cloudy beer, with a good line of carbonation. on the nose, it is very citrusy, with lots of grapefruit and orange. there is also a good dose of sugar. on the palate, it is quite bitter, reminding me that nelson sauvin is a hop that is still more pungent than some other cultivars. the balance, after a few sips, is between a strong bitterness and a good taste of pink grapefruit. it is not the beer of the year - especially coming from hill farmstead, but it drinks quite well."

Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"growler share with henry.
both glasses were poured into tulips.
the appearance was hazy burnt yellow color with a lasting finger s worth of white foamy head that fell off at a moderate pace. some light stringy lace.
the aroma had a majestic blend of lemon pulp sweet to bitterness, some pine, zesty to resinous behavior from the hops, sweet grass and a little bit of sweet wood.
the flavor blended everything so fully bittersweet to guide fully on into the aftertaste and finish wonderfully.
the palate was medium bodied and had a fantastic sipping quality about it. carbonation felt spot on and the abv felt just as projected by the brewer.
overall, always a real treat to have some hill farmstead in my life."

Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"on tap at parker pie. ignoring past inflated ratings this is in my top 3 hoppy beers of all time, right up there with abner and double citra. pours a very very hazy bordering on murkey peach golden color with not much head. aroma is outrageous with white grape, mango, grapefruit, soft melon, and lightly herbal. taste is perfectly balanced malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and an explosion of floral fruitiness from the hops. i love this beer."
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"750ml growler filled 1/19, drunk 1/22/17.
thoroughly hazy, pale, honey-golden body is topped by a firm, white head.
dry, white wine-tinted hop notes pepper the nose, as soft passion fruit, light pineapple and red grapefruit slowly emerge to add a lighter, brighter juiciness. orange marmalade, honey and light biscuit all sit on the finish, with tons of mineral and lots more tropical fruit juice as it warms and breathes. no alcohol or flaw.
the beer begins quite dry, with obvious juicy suggestions; pineapple, passion fruit and light honey from the malts, as well as a bit of white bread and other grain. soft, malty texture, with the typical white wine nuances from the nelson hop and tons of coniferous character on the finish, though mostly resin free. i always get a touch of sharpness from nelson and it s present here, but the fine carbonation, soft texture and juiciness that emerges more and more with warming helps mostly ward it off. very nice stuff, elegant as always, from hill farmstead. could be a little more expressive and complex with the nelson and i won t deny i was hoping for just a tad more juiciness, but that might just be me."

Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"750 ml growler. very hazy orange. big white head. intense nelson aroma. orange, grape, melon, and some resin. tastes equally intense. pithy orange with a strong grape flavor. herbal like it s going to be grassy, but never quite gets there. hefty bitterness. i barely notice how sweet it is until i think about it. tropical fruit sweetness peaks in the very back end. medium heavy. this is stunningly good."

hazy yellow body with a soapy white head. dank aroma showcasing the nelson hop, one of my favorites. absolutely delicious. wish i had more."
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,growler. milkybyellow pour with a white head. apricot bouquet. mild bitterness with big apricot that gives way to mineral and grapefruit notes. freakin  delicious with just enough malt to keep the balance in check. fantastic body and mouthfeel. it really doesn t get much better.
Hill Farmstead Double Nelson,4.4,"on tap at hill farm with joe, pours a hazy orange with small white head. overall notes are sticky and sugary: herbal cat piss, pine, skunk and some grape sugar. a bit boozy and sweet for me, but i will say its better than 90 percent of other 8 percent hoppy beers on the market. i absolutely love single hop nelson but this one seems heavy handed on the nelson cheese which has gotten stronger each year. the older crop seemed more sweaty and galaxy like to me. tried again a couple days later via a growler and it was better than on site (less green/boozy) but still not my favorite. wish shaun would focus more on 4-7 percent hoppy stuff but this is what the kids are craving."
