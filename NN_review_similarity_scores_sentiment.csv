Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"There are not hundreds of beers on my bucketlist anymore, throughout the years I have had the pleasure of tasting many of the world's great beers and I am grateful for each and every one of them, but if there is one beer I have been eager to sip for nearly a decade now, it must be this one: Toppling Goliath's Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout, or KBBS as it is sometimes abbreviated.  A coffee stout aged for over a year in bourbon barrels, it was first released in 2012, but the story goes that at that time, only six people showed up - after which founder Carl Lewey stopped selling it and kept the rest of the batch for private consumption.  I guess he must have known already back then that he was onto something, as the buzz around this beer began to grow and it quickly became one of those modern whales every beer lover in the world wants to taste at least once.  In 2015, KBBS reached number one in the list of top beers on this very website, stoking the hype even further; nine years later, it still holds that same enviable position, as it does on BeerAdvocate (as well as second place - though only recently - on Untappd and Brewver).  It goes without saying that I am very happy to be able to finally taste it today on my birthday, from a 2022 vintage bottle (numbered 1679) just over a year old - and of course I know that a beer like this will probably only improve in coming years, but I just could not resist having it in my collection any longer...  Builds up a light brown, mocha ice-coloured, minute-bubbled and therefore densely creamy head of medium thickness, slowly receding and opening yet retaining well around the edge, with some dots of lacing here and there, over a pitch black beer.  The bouquet is intense - and indeed overwhelmingly beautiful, one sniff already managed to convince me instantly of the whole hype around it: top quality Swiss chocolate, chocolate ganache, top class real maple syrup, the finest Colombian coffee, warm bourbon of some high-end brand, vanillin-breathing oak wood and a lot of it (I love it), homemade coffee brownies, Alicante nougat, armagnac, fudge, expensive Belgian chocolates, crème au caramel, artisanal mocha ice cream, coffee liqueur, more dark bitter chocolate underneath and then all kinds of subtle hints ticking all the boxes of a high-level U.S. style 'impy' varying between almond, roasted pecan nuts, cinnamon, fresh bayleaf, pipe tobacco, fresh fig and even more fruitiness warming up (blackcurrant) but then making room again for wet leather, walnut oil, charcoal briefly showing up only to vanish again in seconds, haemoglobin, rum-soaked raisins, date jam, a very vague minerally touch (clay) - before all that dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and oak return, all intertwined into one monolithic, perfectly aligned and beguiling 'block' of aroma.  In the mouth, the most noble and refined sweetness unfolds, date jam, candied cherries, golden raisins - in a very dense, concentrated manner, with very slight sourish and umami notes here and there, but too subtle to describe; mouthfeel and carbonation are absolutely perfect for this style of beer, rich, velvety, viscously thick yet still oily-smooth, heavily yet supply gliding down the tongue, leaving behind thick layers of fine dark chocolate, toffee, nougat, almond and hazelnut paste, with both the coffee and roasted malts providing bitterness balancing out the sweetness.  An overall bittersweetness fills the mouth in a most complex way, releasing accents of amaretto, bayleaf, cinnamon, light sweet pipe tobacco and, much lighter still, even 'blood' or the juice oozing out of a medium rare steak - all of which matches perfectly without even the slightest sign of a false note, and all of which is enveloped in a noble oaky woodiness (think vanilla and actual wood flavours) and, of course, a long, warming, soothing bourbon bittersweetness, bourbon of high quality in this case, with armagnac- and walnut liqueur-like features.  The finish goes on and on, warming on a cold January night, but more importantly, providing an extended enjoyment of this formidable brew which seems to last forever.  Hops are present 'behind the scenes', with spicy and even very faintly citrus peel-ish details that all contribute to the vast and massive landscape of flavours.  The coffee returns every now and then retronasally, in a most sophisticated way.  This is one to enjoy very slowly and over a very long period of time: as the temperatures shift, one shade of beauty is replaced by another.  This is the one beer I spent the most money on in my twenty-five years of tasting beer in a serious way, but I have no regrets - on the contrary, I am filled with joy and gratitude that after such a long time, this most coveted of the world's craft beers (or one of the most coveted at least) finally reached me.  The number of bottles released each year seems to have grown in past iterations, probably since Toppling Goliath extended their production capacity with a new brewing installment in 2018, so who knows, maybe one day this gem will become a bit more widely available, and when that happens, I will be happy to pay for a second one.  As for now, I suppose I could consider selling the empty bottle, as I noticed one being auctioned in the States for no less than a hundred dollars...  Anyway, to conclude this long journey through this awe-inspiring brew: I think scoring becomes a bit meaningless in the light of not only this beer's inherent perfection and majestic beauty, but also in its consistent high scores in the decade in which it has been in existence.  Additionally, I cannot find anything I do not like here, not even after examining it with a microscope, so to speak, so here you go: the perfect score, mostly symbolically because American style imperial stout really does not get much better than this, at least not in what I have tasted so far.",0.024014605321403704,0.9994

Pours nearly pitch black color and capped by a small tan layer of foam that settles in quickly to a thin film and leaves some nice legging on the glass. The aroma shows notes of rich, dark chocolate, maple syrup, and roasted coffee over a dark roasted malt base with further notes of bourbon and oak laden vanilla. The maple syrup is dominant but the underlying chocolate, coffee, and oaky vanilla shines as it warms up. The flavor follows suit with the dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and maple syrup right up front along with the bourbon oak, vanilla, and a moderate bitterness for balance on the back end. The maple syrup is sweet but tastes like quality grade A stuff compared to fake adjuncts found in other similar beers. Full bodied and slick with moderate carbonation that leads to a bitter sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and bourbon oak on the finish with lingering maple syrup sweetness after each sip.

Very kind fieryness at its height. Well balanced, elegant despite the powerhouse. Definitely making beer that is bigger and beefier, but here it is balanced with elegance.

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"2016. Silver Wax. Bottle 332. So intense! Aroma: Tons of sweet bourbon, maple syrup (more and more after warming up), good choco, molasses, vanilla, a bit walnuts. Perfect. Taste: The same + sour coffee and dark fruits. 4.75/5

// The aroma is heavenly, thunderously intense. Lots of sweet bourbon, maple syrup (more and more noticeable over time), molasses, high-quality chocolate, barrel vanilla, and eventually walnuts. I've never smelled anything that smelled so great. For the first half hour I only took one sip, and the rest of the time I just sniffed this wonder. A rating of 5/5 is not enough.

The first sip and wow, it's thick as fuck. Basically a repeat of what's in the scent + sour coffee and dark red fruits are also added. Alcohol appears modestly after warming up, but it is as noble as possible, typical from the barrel.

I give it 4.75 for taste and mainly for complexity. Subjectively, maybe even ""only"" 4.50 (I don't like sour coffee) - it reminded me quite a bit of some coffee RISs from Cycle - the main difference is better composed alcohol.

This aroma will follow me at night for a long time.",0.0,0.9639

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Travis’s house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 12 oz bottle shared by me. The pour is a thick and heavy dark black with a thin ring of dark mocha colored head that leaves no trace. This thing just sticks to the glass. It’s amazing. The aroma is unbelievable. The balance of heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla fudge, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, molasses, and brown sugar is just amazing. The bourbon barrel adds a wonderful oaky complexity and a hint of bourbon that really ties all of this together. The flavor is equally as amazing. The chocolate and vanilla fudge right up front are spectacular, and the maple comes rolling in with the dark fruits, sweet molasses, coffee, and brown sugar. The bourbon holds off, but remains detectable in each aspect. The balance is great. The mouth feel is unlike anything I’ve had. Period.

Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.

Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin’ Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.

I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers I’ve ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.

Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.

This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin’ Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD.

Appearance: Pitch black with a small very dark brown head, little lacing and some legs. 



Aroma: There’s a burst of coffee at first followed by a really fruity presence and rich caramel/toffee. There’s also some spices/cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, brandy (might just be the fruits though) and fudge. 



Taste: Quite sweet, but well balanced by the coffee acidity. Rich caramel/toffee presence, lots of coffee here too, quite fruity, bourbon, mild spices/cinnamon presence and fudge.



Palate: Full body. Medium carbonation. Thick and silky mouthfeel. Lingering caramel, coffee and fruity finish. Nice alcohol warmth. 



Overall: Excellent barrel-aged RIS. The malt depth is impressive and it’s extremely flavorful and tasty which I guess helps to get some very high ratings from small pours. I liked it a lot, but I didn’t enjoyed it nearly as much as GI Rare (which stunned me when I had it 2 years ago) or Double Black on tap (which was as tasty and more drinkable - yeah no kidding - despite being listed as more than twice the abv of this one).",0.11215443081840885,0.9925

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle 230/300 poured into snifter after having 15 minutes on the counter to warm from the fridge. 

A- Pours a viscous pitch black with a dark brown/mocha head about 1/4 inch high with insane retention for a stout. Detectable carbonation bubbles, but on the low side, as appropriate for style. Over two minutes, the head fades to a mocha ring around the edges of the glass. 

S- Mother of god- this smells like Vermont maple syrup aged in a bourbon barrel, dipped in chocolate, and wrapped with the tears of angels. Honestly though, the syrup sweetness with the wood notes really dominate, although the bourbon notes are just hanging out behind them. 

T- Maybe I am just riding the hype train, but this tastes absolutely amazing. A huge sweet maple sugar (think the little maple butter candies you can buy up in Vermont) followed by a super mellow bourbon barrel character mixed in with chocolate, caramel, and a balancing roast and bitter note. 

M- Thick. A bit more carbonation than I expected for this, but it works well with the beer. This is an oil slick of a beer, as it should be for the style. This is definitely a sipper, but I could (and will) drink a full 12 ounces in one sitting happily.

I really like coffee bombs, I guess it could have used more coffee in this but that might have thrown it off. Because everything really is perfectly balanced. No burn at all. Tried this at an amazing tasting up against some of my favorite ba stouts and this was the best. We opened BC Coffee (my previous #1) right after this and it didn’t even come close.

2014 vintage, on 10/18 at the Malloy tasting, thanks steve, reminded again if how good this is. More maple than I remember.

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"As soon as I cracked this cap, the room was filled with luscious bourbon, roasted malts; caramel; and impressively pungent, high end coffee. Jesus, this smells amazing. 



Taste follows suit: roasty initially before bourbon and coffee interrupt everything and take center stage. Impeccably rounded overall profile. Rivals the very best stouts I’ve ever tasted. World class status is merely implied after the first sip. 



And Kentucky Brunch’s body coats the mouth unlike almost anything else I’ve tasted. The Peg’s stouts are its only peers in this category. 



Holy moly, this is better than Mornin’ Delight... and that isn’t said lightly. Toppling Goliath killed it. Again.  



Update: So it’s been a week, and I’ve decided to upgrade my rating to a perfect 5.  I previously gave it 4/5 on appearance (which is incorrect upon looking at my picture of it afterwards; was trying to be overly picky at the time) and 19/20 for a total of 4.8.

Toppling Goliath Kentucky Brunch🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Draft on tap at Kentucky Brunch Release (Decorah, IA). Pours a rich thick deep black hue, opaque and thick, a frothy brownish head atop dies to a creamy ring, laces ok. Good dark ominous body, good legs. Aromas offer maple and coffee, sticky caramel and some vanilla. Roast, toast, and toffee. Maple syrup, gentle oak, vanilla, and faint whiskey wafting. It’s cold, so some warmth should open this up more. Initial is thick and sweet, touches of maple, oak, and cocoa. Sticky caramel, dark roast is mellow grows as it warms. The coffee comes out a bit more roast, a good intensity up front as it trails off, firm presence in the middle. Sticky and firmly flavored, roasty with good vanilla, barrel flavor as we round the corner. Vanilla, coffee, sticky caramel. Toffee, espresso, and richer coffee as we round up, a bit more roasty, sticky, barrel flavor. The base is still thick and firm, not making this pick up much if any heat from the barrel. Oak, roasty, and coffee. I think this is much more drinkable than the Mornin’ Delight. It’s sweet, but not nearly as much. Thick and full, but not overwhelming. The coffee element comes on at just the right time. Really well put together. I prefer this to Mornin, which may just be sensory overload. This one is the gem.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"Here we are then: the barrel aged version of one of Sweden's most coveted beers, the honey-flavoured Stormaktsporter by family brewery Närke, the fame of which is due in large part to this very website - as is the fame of this Kaggen version, coming in second on the list of the ""best beers of the world"" (and holding a similar position on both Untappd and Brewver).  Needless to say, I just had to taste this one when I unexpectedly got the opportunity, as the 2019 vintage (one of several since the first one appeared in 2005) has, since this year only, been sold through a selection of specialist shops in several countries including the Netherlands and Denmark.  No doubt the 'whale' value of this legendary beer has waned a bit due to this very fact - several online shops still stock it today and ship internationally - but it remains one of those bucket list beers I have been dreaming of for years, and now a bottle finally reached my tasting table.  Medium thick, dense and creamy, lightly membrane-like lacing, greyish beige, stable head very slowly breaking over an opaque black robe - showing a burgundy red hue only at the very end.  Dense and initially somewhat 'closed' aroma, gradually unfolding an array of beguiling scents: cocoa nibs and high quality dark chocolate, pronounced oak wood (still including a vanillin touch), molasses, whisky, ground walnuts, cold espresso, dried prunes, roasted almonds, aquavit, freshly crushed black peppercorns, dry caramel, warm brown bread (crust), fudge, dried figs, dark brown honey, dried heather, some light notes of reduced beef stock, bayleaf, clay, cinnamon rolls, burnt blackcurrants, old ebony wood, Japanese soy sauce, dried beech leaves, wet leather and salmiak.  Dense onset with a perfectly tuned, i.e. somewhat restrained and 'noble' sweetness (dried fig, dried blueberry or blackberry, touch ripe blue plum) with a faint hint of beef stock- or gravy-like umami surrounding it, softly carbonated with immediately thick, heavily oily, 'viscous' mouthfeel.  Thick malt slabs of dark chocolate, black cocoa, brown bread, fudge and cold black coffee ensue, piled on top of each other but working as one compact bittersweet whole filling the entire mouth cavity - as any decent imperial stout or imperial porter should, of course.  The subdued sweet dark fruit and umami beef stock accents travel along this huge dark maltiness, which increases in bitterness as the roasted effects build up and a robust amount of peppery hops, well hidden under all that dark maltiness but adding considerable bitterness 'behind the scenes', starts to set in; dryness is achieved by a pronounced woodiness (bringing back those wonderfully noble oak aromas retronasally) but also by the booze, which was noticeable early on already and grows in the end - with whisky- and gin-like effects.  The alcohol puts up a fight against that massive malt bittersweetness and almost wins, but things get balanced again in the finish and aftertaste, where this alcohol warmth and spiciness makes the malt bittersweetness glow up in the dark rather than brutally scorching it, as it sometimes does in conceptually similar beers.  Glimpses of praliné, bayleaf, liquorice and marmite subtly and briefly pop up in the aftertaste.  This is indeed high nobility, a beer to contemplate in serenity and in earnest, and even though the booziness is perhaps just a tad too strong for me (I really must find the basic Stormaktsporter one day) even after three years of maturing in the bottle, there is no doubt that this brew fully deserves its near-mythical status, with an old-fashioned roasty bitterness, perfect mouthfeel for its style, utterly solid structure and density of flavours.  The perfect accompaniment to a chilly evening in late December and with whales like this, I cannot but give a 'symbolic' score of near perfection.  Another one off the bucket list, and worth every penny.",0.0,0.9957

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"Imperial Stout with the addition of heather honey brewed on October 26, 2016. Aged for 3 months in oak bourbon barrels. 

💣 2nd best RIS in the world!! 

Right behind the famous KBBS from Toppling Goliath Brewing Co.!! 💣 

Alcohol: 12% by volume. 

Color: Black, opaque. 

Foam: Dark cream, unstable, composed of small eyes. The initial, narrow strip of foam quickly disappeared from view. Zero glass decorations. 

Smell: The aroma is beautiful, but subdued. It is not artificial and exaggerated in any direction. 
You can feel a lot of dark fruit, caramel, plums, milk chocolate and vanilla. After a while it opens like a flower to extract notes of oak, wood, molasses and heather honey. 
Only for a moment there was a whiff of roasted malts and delicate coffee.

The aroma is a cross between notes that I know from Imperial Stouts and Barley Wine.

Taste: What interests me most about this beer is of course the taste.
You have to give it a chance. The beginning is not easy at all.
Such a universal Imperial Stout rich in notes of chocolate, coffee with the addition of milk, molasses, dark fruits and almond nuts.
After the drink has warmed up significantly, interesting elements begin to appear: heather honey, spices, herbs, oak and vanilla.
The noble alcohol warms the chest. The texture of Kaggen is only moderate, you can look in vain for thick, thick nuances here.
The fullness changes with time, heading for a semi-dry finish.
The alcohol is well covered.

Carbonation: Medium to low.

Summary:

Närke Kulturbryggeri Kaggen Stomaktsporter 2016 - well, a legend, a legend, but someone who has already drunk a few highly rated Imperial Stouts in their life, this beer will not make a big impression.

However, it should be given credit for its interesting flavor profile, non-standard addition (heather honey), interesting barrel notes and smooth reception.

With all due respect to my Swedish colleagues who are spinning a spiral around this beer - it is not worth its price 😉

There is no point in killing yourself for those 25 centilitres.
There are many more interesting and cheaper beers, even in Europe.

Peace’n’love my dear Swedish mafia!!😉🍺💣🍻💥",0.0397778642087865,0.9857

2008: Black with creamy beige-brown crown. Caramel, really creamy salted licorice fudge, black currants, tar paste, licorice strips. Big, nice body with a lot of barrel character. Tannins from the oak are nicely integrated and give a nice sour note together with sweetness from bourbon and tar stillage, cane sugar, fine malt sweetness and roasted notes. After a while, more fruity notes of dark berries come; such as blackberries and blackcurrants. Still some heat from the alcohol and barrel ageing, but it's so incredibly nicely integrated and cohesive. The taste from the first mouthfuls lingers for a long time. Extremely well made and so very nicely matured. At the same time, there is not the slightest tendency to see that it has passed its peak. Masterpiece! 4.7

2016: Black with fancy creamy beige foam puck. Very clear heather honey tone in the scent. Also dark berries, blackberries/blackcurrants, coffee syrup, tar paste, licorice strips. Fairly large, round and smooth body. Nice cask character that still feels quite young and lively. Rough and slightly sour from the oak. A bit of fire and heat from the alcohol and barrel ageing.

Opaquest dark brown, a total black hole swirl of a tan head. Rich sugary dusting. Dark smooshed figs, toasted coconut and isolated grab of raisins as it warmed and a welcoming porty porter core.

Stabbing richness towards the finish, speckled fizzing out heat on the finish.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"Traded a Blabaer 750ML 2011 for this tiny bottle. Enjoyed at 50 Degrees F and allowed to warm up slowly. This is a 2009 vintage at 9.5%. Full macho American pour into my large stemmed De Dolle Glass.



A - Pours oily, totally black out of the bottle into the glass. A 2 finger coffee colored head forms and fades over the course of 90 seconds to a thin ring and minor sea-foam consistent bubbles. The stickiness of the head is resilient as it swirls around in the glass. Pitch black, not oily but pretty damn black in the glass. 



S - Nose is interesting. I get almost a mix of espresso creamy latte with lactose and fresh roasted coffee mixed with the sweet booziness of rum barrels. There is a hint of vanilla beans and dark chocolate.



T - Interesting. This may be the most roasted beer I’ve ever had like a mix between roasted coffee and roasted oak over a fire. Not campfire smokiness but just very roasted. There’s a huge chocolate presence at the start, the middle is latte with vanilla added and the finish is this roast bomb with an almost astringent booziness like what you get after drinking cheap cough medicine. In the back of my throat I get a grain alcohol like taste like swallowing freezing cold vodka but the burn is always the same.



M - Velvety and sort of fudge like but you know the feeling you’re left with after eating chocolate covered espresso beans? that’s pretty much what this feels like but in liquid form.



O - I’m overall pretty disappointed in this beer. Tickers GOTTA tick but I really don’t feel that this is worth either the hype or the trade bait. There’s too much roasted notes, way too boozy for a 9.5% beer and the astringency never goes away.

Almost zero release of air pressure when opened. Viscous body pours from the tiny bottle leaving minimal bubbles up top but no actual head. Chocolate and roasted malts swirl amongst toffee in the nose, creating a delicate aroma that simply isn’t strong enough. The first victim of age, perhaps? 



Stormaktsporter boasts an intense, potent, complex flavor profile. Deeply roasted malt; rich, decadent chocolate; booze character integrates marvelously with the stout base. Not super complex, but the chocolate in this beer is arguably the best of any stout I’ve encountered. Also, the balance here is impeccable.

Nicely complex, but the main thing about this beer is the balance. the aroma is a little less so, but the flavor is stunning.

The beer appears quite similar to the standard version. Dark brown, nearing black, with a dark beige head that leaves an oily film gently descending the snifter.

A distinctly European aroma. It seems to me that Närke, Nøgne Ø, Mikkeller, etc. possess distinctive characteristics not found in American stouts. Hooray for diversity and the unique aspects found in beers throughout the world. Anyhow...the beer smells terrific. Roast, chocolate, barrels, a touch of booze.

The flavor does not disappoint. Thick, chewy, viscous stout that coats the palate and melts in your mouth. The barrel character is outstanding. Present, but not overbearing. Beautifully balanced. Dark fruits, chocolate, roast, malt, barrels blending together in harmony.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"2007 nip bottle at Akkurat in Stockholm.  A few days earlier I drank full bottles of the 2006 and 2008 Stormaktsporter, and while both were considered very, very good, I felt the 2006 was faded and the 2008 was still a bit too bright and green.  This led me to choose the 2007 as the Kaggen! vintage to try at Akkurat a few days later.  My previous rating is from a nip bottle of the 2005, split two ways in 2008, sampled amid a number of other beers of varying style, bitterness and alcohol.  given the tendency of Narke beers to be somewhat mellow, focusing more on presenting a flavorful, balanced beer drinking experience rather than a bold, in-your-face drinking experience, my thoughts were lost, only preserved in notes taken four years ago.  So I truthfully had no opinion about the Kaggen from that long-ago taste.  I decided on this trip that I would experience Narke Stormaktsporter as if it were completely unknown to me.  The hype surrounding the beer is hard to ignore, but I feel like I can be honest with myself about quality given all of the things I’ve drank, where I’ve been in my beer travels, and how often I seem to go against the grain.  I’ve spent untold amounts of money on beer I didn’t enjoy, cheap and expensive both.  I trusted myself to honestly evaluate the Kaggen without consideration of rarity, reputation or pricetag. Combine this with the fact that so many people have had 4.5+ ""wow"" moments with this beer, and I know there’s something in here to find.  My previous rating was rather unexciting, so I figured I didn’t get the full experience, and this was my shot. So with that all said, how was the beer?  



First pour: early on the beer has limited expression given the temperature, a bit colder than is ideal. Early on the nose presents  a chewy and creamy melted chocolate chip dark malt character with light touches of faded whiskey and oak. The body is exceptionally savory and frothy, suggesting chocolate fudge and fluffy but savory cake.  There is slow growing alcohol warmth as the beer begins to blossom and open up with time, and after about 10 minutes it becomes difficult to put into words... surreal decadence, that would put it best. Prickly, just-bitter cocoa nibs and fudge cake softness with a velvety body.  Later on, approaching room temperature, the nose develops some metal and paint yeast notes but it’s really quite mild and doesn’t spoil the decadent spongy fudge cake deliciousness.  Some mild smoke and char are at play later on, and the whiskey remains happily subdued and well-matched for the moderate roast and soft, decadent body.  The last sips show a bit more whiskey and alcohol, as expected, but still remains creamy and chewy and perfectly suited for it’s size.  Delicious.  And no fish sauce whatsoever.



previous rating of 2005 vintage sampled in 2008: Appearance is deep black, no apparent light passing through the edges of my glass.  A deep brown head sites on top, and when swirled the brown, thick lacing clings to the sides of the glass and slowly crawls back down.  Very attractive splotchy lacing.  First impression of the nose is rich dark chocolate and a slightly hot aroma of whiskey with faint charred wood as well. For sure the whiskey is not overpowering, and I’d probably say it’s one of the few beers that used whiskey barrel aging is a truly complimentary role.  The (faint) char, rich (but not heavy) smoke, and malty scotch notes work together really, really well.  First taste is rich chocolate and sharp whiskey, again, complimentary rather than dominating, with oak barrel and delicate, toasted chocolate malts coating the mouth.  Over the back it’s slightly warming, very mellow and smooth, leaving a rich toffee, amaretto and resinous whiskey coating on the tongue.  A few times I even pick up some nice, moist tobacco as well.",0.10838556292068097,0.9987

And difficult, extremely difficult to hive off single components. It’s burned sugar, molasses, apricot, oak, vanilla, plum, cherries, chocolate, coffee, syrup, spice, herbs. Bond between all that stuff is almost indivisible, even more in taste, it comes out an holistic property. Difficult to explain. But fact is, and could seem a paradox, separately from complexity, Kaggen! isn’t difficult to have, even though 25 cl is the best format, because hits directly the bull’s eye of senses without hesitation. You don’t need to be an experienced taster for appreciation and understand you’re facing something SO BIG. Moreover, it’s pointless making long analysis and list all flavors, since the best side it’s just the wholeness of such a full body; warms mouth and palate, in a great alternation between sweetness and bitterness (more the first) and the PERFECT balance of malts and hops. Herbaceous character, given by heather honey, isn’t invasive and oak aging as well. It’s ambrosia, no way. Breweries like Närke aren’t just their hype-geek productions, try other ones (cAmarillo, Örebro Bitter, and so on) and you’ll catch how they great could be as artisans.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"2008 bottle. Pours thick and black with an average brown head. Looks decadent. Nose is mellow yet potent at the same time. Light smoke, melon, spice, chocolate, roasted coffee, oak, apricot, maple syrup and alcohol.  Super complex. Flavor is sweet up front. Rich. Bitter peeks through and becomes more prominent in the middle and balances well for a bittersweet dry finish. Mouthfeel is like heaven on the tongue. Unreal how good this is. Believe the hype kids.

Aroma is complex and heavenly: to me it smelled like they placed the finest RIS in a delicious port wine barrel. Chocolate, oak, red wine, red berries, coffee, licorice. Taste is on the same level, extremely smooth and balanced, with a fantastic complexity. Again, chocolate, red berries, red wine, wood and coffee beans. I’m not sure if this is the age of the bottle speaking here, but this was the most gentle and yet delicious imperial stout ever tried. It retained all the flavours os typical roasty ones, but without the sometimes overwhelming bitterness. This was less bitter then average RIS to me, it struck a perfect balance. And yet so much complexity. Heavenly. Body is thick and oily with a the perfect amount of carbonation. This is probably the first exceptionally-hyped beer that I truly enjoy as expected.

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/30/2011.  Poured from a 8 oz. bottle into a tasting glass. 2008 vintage. 

Kaggen! Stormaktsporter has a typical RIS look - ebony black color with a fairly thin tan head of creamy bubbles slowly fades to a collar and leaves a thin sheet of lace. 

The aroma is very balanced and smooth. Some sweet bourbon, raisins, figs, and dark roasted malt are all subtle and blended so well together. Dark chocolate and a bit of espresso round out the nose.

The flavor is pretty much exactly what I want out of a barrel aged imperial stout. Smooth, sweet bourbon comes in first and slowly lets in the fig, raisin, cherry, and roasted malt blend beautifully together. Some dark chocolate fudge, vanilla, and light espresso notes are in the background. The finish has a bit more bourbon and finishes fairly clean.

The carbonation is smooth, with just enough crispness to excite the tongue along with the bourbon. The body is on the fuller side of medium and consistent all the way through. Slightly sticky on the lips.

Clearly, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have had. No individual flavor really stands out, but the flavors in concert work so well together.",0.0,0.955

Närke Kaggen Stormaktsporter🇸🇪Stout - Imperial,"250mL 2008 big thanks to omhper! The pour is significantly improved over the normal 2007 Stormaktsporter. A very lively, large, blooming, deep brown head erupts on a near jet black body. Lacing is sheety, large, and sticky. Aroma is very intense: fruity, floral, buttery, maple, something not unlike bourbon but more akin to brandy and spiced orange. As it warms, very heavy buttery bourbon comes through even though this has no bourbon component in the aging. More spiced orange comes through again with licorice and mild peat. Later, I get a lot more orange, potpourri, heavy clove and cinnamon. Taste is very different from the normal version. Up front this is sharp and citrusy, mild butter and spicy oak in the mid, and finishes neutral, tannic, and rich with bourbon, oil, and coconut similar to Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Palate is slightly carboardy and mildly dusty. Not super oily or thick. Very different from the normal Stormaktsporter. Not coffee, chocolate, or bourbon forward. More neutral malty, bitter orange, mild coffee. Pretty good but not mind blowing. Definitely not the best beer in the world unfortunately. Inferior to Misto BA or even De Molen Heaven and Hell. Overall relatively weak sauce, tart, mild, thinner. Definitely a sad product of hype, rarity, and biased ratings.",0.04856429311786321,-0.963

Westvleteren 12🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"BEST QUADRUPPEL!!! AND BEST BEER IN THE WORLD!!!
The Westvleteren 12 tops several tasting lists and can also be found on YouTube under the term ""Best Beer in the World"". It comes into the glass dark brown with a beige, mixed-pore head that has a medium stability. The smell is reminiscent of a cider cellar with a high earthy content. The alcohol is particularly noticeable. When I first sip it, I expected an explosion of flavor that would knock you over immediately and forever. Nothing like that. The Quadrupel comes across subtly with plum, liqueur, berries, vanilla, dark chocolate and light caramel. The beer is slightly sweet but just enough to be really masculine. I'm sure I'll get hate mail again for this comment. I sense other flavors, but don't want to name them out of uncertainty. A second tasting is necessary. I didn't even notice that the beer was almost empty, so now the finish: The alcohol becomes more dominant and, together with the hops, brings a noticeable and very well-balanced bitterness into play. This allows the previously mentioned aromas, which are still there, to be experienced in a different light. Absolutely fantastic. This is guaranteed to be the best Quadrupel I have ever drunk. As for the best beer: I don't think that this beer is the best in Cuba on the beach at 34 degrees or that a Radler lover would like it. That's why the term is ridiculous to me and different for every viewer. I also find it incomprehensible to give such a masterpiece 3 stars, but that's just how people taste. 06-2020",0.0,0.9872

Pours a hazy dark amber to brown with a stable, foamy, tan head. Very expressive aroma of tawny port, red wine, wood, red apple slices, dried banana, pear, overripe blue plum, brown bread, baker's yeast, artisan milk chocolate, chestnut. Taste has a sweet estery mix of blue plum, red apple, dried banana & raisin in a thick brown-bready, slightly toasty, somewhat chocolatey malt body with a hint of candi sugar, but never in a cloying way, surrounded by a spicy and a dry-yeasty note, and even a sourish dark-fruity streak. The herbal & peppery hoppy finish offers more dried & candied fruits, spices and 'dry' brown bread and even a very vague hint of coffee. The whole is topped off with a noble, vinous warmth of brandy-like alcohol. Medium to full body, creamy-moussy texture, average carbonation (toning down when warming up).

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",0.13206763594884355,0.9892

So before tried this unique beer i get the ""St bernardus 12"" because people said these two beers had the same recipe and are very similar. So i want to say to them :Its not the same beers. The difference are massive.
If we clear that lets go to the review.
When i open the beer one punchy full of flavors aroma fill my roam from nowhere. The aroma cover my entire room for fun. But the most shock thing wasent the aroma but the taste. When the beer touch my mouth, it bites my tongue and cover my entire mouth with insane flavors that i never had again. I had feel the same thing only once from ""Rochefort 10"" that also bites your tongue and your mouth very aggressive. But ""Westvleteren 12"" do that more aggressively. The beer has the best mouthfeel i ever get from anything in my life. 
The taste is so complex and so unique. The beer is very sweet and at the same time bitter with a lot of caramel, chocolate, fruity notes. And the finish it has 3 long directions. In the beginning it gives you one aggressive and punchy bitterness and in some secs that become sweet and again it change in some warm bitterness at the end. Really i cant described that. The feeling was mind blowing. The carboration is little high for one ""Quadrupel"" beer but it stick perfectly here.
Overall the best beer i have get/tried today. No because is the best on paper but because its the best for me. Simply the beer is a real monster. The most complex and unique beer i have tried for sure!",0.0,0.9769

I can't really describe it, but the after tastes reminds me vaguely about fermantated/ too ripe banana and that spoils it for me.

Overall:  Rarely do beers live up to the hype, but this is truly a world class beer, even within a rich, complex style with plenty of great examples. Drinks surprisingly easy for a beer this complex and rich in maltiness. So many layers of flavor, all well rounded and smooth",0.24999999999999994,0.9889

Westvleteren 12🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"Well, the hype is real.
Trying to put away the external factors when tasting/evaluating this beer is difficult, because they are an integral part of the experience. Its relative exclusivity, the confirmation bias that comes with the huge undertaking of buying this beer at the abbey, the feel of the place, the low-key bottle (oh, how I love the unblemished trappist bottle where the cap holds all the information), the crate and last but not least, the ratings and reviews - the hype.
 
The appearance is immaculate. The color of the beer and the look and feel of the foam are just... right. In the Westvleteren glass it looks almost understated, yet oh so inviting. 
The smell is understated too, maybe a tad too much, as when I first smelled it my stomach wrenched in worry that it would not deliver as promised. 

Well, it does deliver. It really, really does. 
Trying to describe the taste in detail is a bit meaningless for me, it is too complex. It has many of the tastes you expect from a dark trappist, dark fruits, nuts and all that other nonsense which I am not good at describing, but what sets this one apart from the rest of the trappists, and other belgian triples and quadruples for that matter, is a taste I can best describe as a soft bitterness. But its not really soft either, its there, and it fits so ... again, right. It gives the beer a dimension I have not experienced in other of its kind.

Either way. I realize I could never shake off my aforementioned confirmation bias, but hopefully the description of my experience could convince you to try it, as the hype is most definitely real.",0.0,0.8285

Westvleteren 12🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"I was expecting more of an aroma, as I feel it's not a particularly intense one. Still quite good anyway, with notes of dried fruit, marzipan, toffee, licorice and liquor. Pours dark brown with a nice, thick, light beige head. Taste is mostly sweet and fills your mouth. Slightly too carbonated in my opinion, but it's still a nice mouthfeel, neither too thick nor too watery. Aftertaste is pretty intense, boozy, with a sweetness that lingers for a while. Pairs well with dried fruit, nuts and chocolate. While I do think it's a very good beer, I also feel like it's not THAT good and it's fame is due mostly to how difficult it used to be to find a bottle (I don't think that's the case anymore).

Westvleteren 12🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"It's much more than a simple bottle that was standing in front of me that I was about to uncap, it's a real myth... which was born for me a little over 4 years ago when I started to take an interest in the world of beer and discovered the different classifications and which was then fueled by its rarity and the often excessive price that a bottle could reach when I came across one (everything that is rare is expensive... which does not put it within everyone's reach, and for a long time, not mine). The suspense was therefore going to end, and for me the answer to my questions about this famous beer. Visually, nothing to complain about, we are close to the 8 with a clear dark brown topped with a creamy foam of 1.5 cm. The nose is surprisingly, even worryingly, very discreet. We still find an alcohol with accents of cognac, candy and fruits with plum and pear. All being not very intense. Fortunately the tasting is quite different! And, if the intensity of this Westleveren XII is not the most incredible in the world, it shows an exceptional balance that would make it become a saint all devilish (is this a strategy of the monks to evangelize Belgium?). This beer is classy, ​​with an assertive alcohol, on airs of cognac, but not aggressive and combining perfectly with the bitterness and a malty base where the prune takes the lead without being predominant. Obtaining such a balance is necessarily the fruit of very long years of experience and an extraordinary mastery of brewing. So thank you to the monks for having worked in this direction and for having protected a unique heritage. But let's get back to the tasting. Compared to the 8, what changes is of course the alcohol, which takes on much more character here while remaining very well integrated, but also the spices, less present here and with more developed prune aromas. The complexity is excellent from the attack which takes up the aromas developed by the nose with in addition notes of candy and pepper. The second mouth takes its ease more and on the back palate, it is the spices and the prune which take the ascendancy. The finish, very long marks a marriage of alcohol and bitterness quite remarkable as is this beer. To know then if it is the best beer in the world, I think finally that this question is meaningless. What do we ask of a beer? First and foremost to be balanced and secondly to give us emotion. And if the first point is factual, the second is very personal. Each of us will be more sensitive to intensity, bitterness, alcohol or complexity. As in the quest for any Grail, the important thing is above all in the path, the beers discovered day after day, the experience acquired but especially in the encounters made throughout this path which are for me a source of incomparable enrichment. And so I thank this Westlevern XII for all this. An emotion is little if it is not shared.",0.0,0.9828

Strong, intense aroma, there is roastiness, ground coffee, cocoa, dried fruit, caramel, nuts. 
The taste is similar, there is coffee, chocolate, nuts, dried fruit, pralines and cocoa. Bitterness reminds me of bitter cocoa. 
Alcohol hidden perfectly, there is not even typical warming in the esophagus. High carbonation, quickly satiates. High fullness, the beer is simply thick, thick.

Brown, burgundy color, lots of yeast particles floating in the liquid. White, low and generally not durable foam. 
Bread aroma, melanoid, you can feel some nutty, rum notes. There is candied sugar, spicy, herbal accents, and finally dark, dried fruit. In the background delicate wine notes. The aroma is very complex, multidimensional.

The taste is slightly sweet with a distinct dry note. Similarly to the aroma, there are a lot of bread and malt accents, there is candied sugar, wine, rum, and spicy notes. There are dark, dried, fried fruits. The whole is rich and very coherent.

The alcohol subtly warms the esophagus. High carbonation, for me the beer is overcarbonated. Medium to high body. Smooth, soft texture. Delicate but long aftertaste - dark fruit and melanoids.

Taste is smooth from beginning to end; sweet dark fruits, cranberry juice, red grapes, blackberries, dark raisins, a hint of vanilla, cocoa, and wood. Syrupy mouthfeel with no carbonation. Not overly sweet, and the acid balances out the sweetness so beautifully, something I could drink all night long.

Perfect fit for rating # 3000. A very special bottle indeed. First because it was offered to me as a present for my graduation by Greg, Askofficerfriendly and his wife. Second, a celebration of my bday and return to Belgium, and third, probably the first B.Nektar mead to make it to Europe and one of my favorite US meadery.
This one goes out to you Greg/Bridget and the good folks at B.Nektar!

Pours a deep burgundy with an outstanding clear syrupy filament/coating on the glass.
The aroma brings this mead to another level by the depth of the fruits being used. One can easily pick a medley of currants, raspberries and cherries where one scent leaves room to another never to overtake the experience.
Perfect bouquet of honey follows adding this ever enjoyable organic natural fragrance.
The mouthfeel is similar to the aroma and a bouquet of orchard brings fantastic dimensions to the mead. Great blend between the fruits leaving room for each cherry, raspberries and currants to be noticed.  The honey adds a great balance to the acidity of the fruits that although not overpowering was enough to give me a nice heartburn quickly following the first glass (a first with all B.Nektar) and that was the low point of the whole experience. The honey also leaves a mild sweet syrupy sticky finish on the lips that is very enjoyable.

Cigar City Pilot Series Dragonfruit Passion Fruit Berliner Weisse🇺🇸Berliner Weisse - Flavored / Catharina Sour,"Draft at Cigar City during Hunahpu Day 2012. 

Pours a dark blood/beet red color that’s almost purple with a one finger pink foam head that quickly settles into a thin ring.  Minimal lacing left behind.  Definitely a unique looking beer.  Don’t see many that have that color.

The aroma is bursting with sweet tropical fruit.  I’m not very familiar with either of these fruits but the tropical fruit presence dominates the nose.  Slightly seedy with a decent amount of funk but the aroma is all about the dragonfruit/passionfruit.  Could use a bit more funk/traditional berlinerweisse character but still smells really good.

Medium bodied with a nice balance of tart funkiness and sweet tropical fruit.  More balanced than the nose suggests with some lactic funk, acidity and bready yeast but it’s still dominated by sweet, juicy fruit notes.  Very sweet but with enough acidity and funk to keep it from becoming one dimensional.  Very refreshing with a crisp dry finish.  A lot of people went apeshit over this beer and while I think that’s it’s really good, it didn’t completely blow me away.

This beer looks stunning and played a huge role in getting the word out. The body is a brilliant bright pink that is semi clear and looked great and refreshing in the sun... The aroma was fantastic, it was very tart but balanced by sweet tropical fruits. Perfectly balanced sweet and tart... This is again sweet on the fruit showing off tons of fresh Florida fruits, also shows off a tart note from the fruit.

T: The color may have sent people running it was the flavor that brought them back. The beer was awesome simply put. Nice sharp tartness right up front. Slighty citric, my guess this was provided by the dragon fruit After the initial blast of tartness it actually smooths out real nicely. A nice mild sweetness comes through almost guava like which I will attribute to the passion fruit. A Yin and Yang of a beer, tart, sweet, awesome, and stunningly beautiful.

The color on this thing just screams dragon-fruit. It was my second beer of the day the first being a breakfast glass of 4 Roses BB Zhukov so this was a wake up call.

Taste was serious business dragon fruit/passion fruit and yes strawberry jolly ranchers was a great description. It made me smack my chops three or four times after each sip and it made my mouth water for more.

Everyone was carrying around the festival something that looked like Kool-aid burst so I decided to find out what it was. Lo and behold, Dragon Passionfruit Berliner Weisse. The pour is a hilariously deep, clear pink with a nice, fizzy pink head. Looks like a fruit juice spritzer. Aroma is heavy seedy raspberries, odd phenol character. Taste is heavy berry tannic, fully tart like a passionfruit smoothie. Some people at the festival claimed it wasn’t very tart, which is incorrect. Very refreshing and nicely done. Definitely something to pursue for the normal CCB lineup- bound to be the most loved beer in the world by women in their 20s.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"650 mL bottle. Originally reviewed 3/3/2012.
Inky black and viscous looking. A vigorous pour yields only a slight chocolate head. No retention to speak of.

Smells wonderful. Bourbon, but so well integrated. It’s not a bourbon bomb like regular BCBS. Vanilla and oak blend seamlessly with the chocolate stout flavors. Far less boozy than regular BCBS. Even less boozy than Big John.

Initial tingly bourbon flavor followed by vanilla and caramel malts. The flavor fades to a darker malt roast of chocolate and coffee. Very sweet, but almost forgivable given the flavors at play. The sweetness gives it a slightly fruity flavor that complements the roast nicely. Like chocolate covered cherries.

Regular BCBS tastes like it’s 20% alcohol. This tastes nowhere near 13%. It’s amazing how dramatically it changes the beer. Still immensely sweet and a slow drink. Thick, viscous, and low in carbonation.

It’s a really good stout. Much better than BCBS. Worth the money? Probably not.

Pours viscous, pitch black and completely opaque with a half finger mocha head that immediately disappears. No lacing left behind but it does have lasting legs that coat the glass in a muddy film. 

Barrel character is really strong in the nose but it seems nicely integrated into aroma. Lots of spicy bourbon but it’s not overpowering with dry oak, toasted coconut and vanilla bean notes. Sweet, slightly roasted malt backbone with sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, coffee bean, baker’s chocolate and subtle roast/burnt malt. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with subtle viscosity and an excellent barrel character that’s perfectly integrated into the base beer. Spicy bourbon barrel with toasted coconut, marshmallow, vanilla and a wonderful spicy PVW flavor. Subtle boozy heat but not fiery, harsh or overpowering. Tastes just like the spirit without obliterating the base beer. Sure, there’s some sweet booze and heat lingering throughout but the other barrel notes and malt backbone counter things nicely. Fudge-y chocolate goodness with fudge, caramel, molasses and toffee give it a sweet and dessert like quality but it’s not one-note. There’s some roast with hints of dark chocolate, roasted gourmet coffee bean, burnt toast and oatmeal. The high ABV is extremely well masked making this delicious, complex beer dangerously drinkable.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Bottle #11755

Opened with an ’08 next to it (courtesy of Rob, thanks dude!) It is amazing to compare side by side what the barrel and time did in this beer.

Opened on a Wednesday, just because. Pours a nice dark leather with no discernable carbonation - which suits this beer. When I dive into the beer I experience a nose only similar to on other beer I’ve had - ORF 2009. The Pappy 23 barrels DO actually impart a unique nose and it’s minerally, rich, dessert like and difficult for me to describe. Flavor follows and is quite rich. A really fine, nearly empty carbonation allows the medium on heavy beer to roll over the tongue slowly and results in a long finish. 

There are some things here that are interesting - no carb really, resulting in a less than desirable mouthfeel and appearance. That’s a standard feeling, but here I am making concessions, as the beer is still lovely and feels very, very nice. I don’t know if it was intentional, but these two characteristics match the personality of the beer outstandingly.

A - Pours pitch black, not quite as oily as I thought it would be, minimal head with almost no lacing. Appeared mostly flat



S - Licorice, Vanilla, Plums, Coconut and charred oak were the biggest notes. Smell was something bigger though, something I couldn’t quite place my finger on but it smells fantastic.



T - Very little sweetness, Lots of flavors going on, very big but yet well integrated bourbon notes. After drinking a lot of Pappy and other wheated bourbons lately, this tastes just like Pappy 20 at least as far as the bourbon notes go. Not too oaky, loaded with vanilla, some plums, brown sugar, candy corns, not too sweet at the finish and NOT boozy. 



M - Oily, slick and heavy. Not fudge-like or thick but smooth and just a bit thinner than ’10 BCBS in a 12oz format



O - It’s amazing how drinking half of this bomber was so easy not because it was tasteless but because it was so refined and not boozy at all. BCBS Rare is not the king any more though.

Appearance wise it is identical to BCBS, no surprise there. Having never had the 2008 vintage which this beer is using, I can say its awfully similar to how the 2009 vintage is drinking now. There is a stronger vanilla presence and it is smoother and mellower than the standard beer. Just loads of chocolate, charred malt, and rich and decadent bourbon.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Review #400

Pulled this guy out of the cellar. Bottle #574 split with friends at my engagement party. Bottled 11/19/2010. 22 oz. bottle served in a Deschutes tulip.

A: Pours a pitch black color with a dark wood head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring and leaves some splotchy and sticky lace down the glass.

S: Wonderful sweet bourbon, roasted malts and dark fruits are harmoniously all wafting out of the glass. Some light oak and chocolate come up as the beer warms. It’s a very smooth and delicious smell.

T: Just simply divine. Deliciously smooth bourbon, this Pappy 23 is so smooth and sweet. Nice dark fruit malts with a little dried, salted plum flavor. A nice mix of savory and sweet. Once the bourbon flavors die down a little the actual barrel comes out with nice mild, woody oak and a bit of char. Sweet caramel and smooth vanilla. Nice brownie flavors with some bittersweet chocolate and great roasted malts.

M: Smooth and creamy with medium to low carbonation, but it is a tad thin even for a barrel aged beer. I would have liked a bit more chew, but it just goes down so smooth with a mild warmth it’s really a nitpicking complaint.

O: Basically perfect. There is no overt alcohol flavors that are offputting, just the deliciously smooth and sweet PVW barrel. Decadent flavors with an awesome combination of sweet and savory this is a must try for any stout fan. It was my only one, but I couldn’t imagine sharing it with anyone but my friends on a really special occasion. Hopefully I can try this beauty again some day!

The appearance is a beautiful jet black with a high viscosity and a perfect deep brown head. The Pappy Van Winkle Barrels pour out in the nose. Loads of oak, maple syrup, coffee and chocolate tones as well. The bourbon is also very forward in the flavors. There is a distinct heat to the mouth but the smoothness and density of flavors completely distracts you from it.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Thanks to Forgetfu for the bottle. Much appreciated
Bottle #7566 poured into a Great Divide tulip

A-- Opened bottle and a white fume of smoke came billowing out of the bottle. Very nice. Poured motor oil black, small dark brown/ dark mocha colored head that quickly dies off, leaving a dark mocha colored ring around the sides. A little bit of head retention but it is more of a rebuilding of the film. 

S-- Where to begin? Oak, bourbon, stewed vanilla beans, and dark fruits. Layers and layers of flavors in the nose. The ABV is evident in the nose but much more restrained than what BCS Vanilla and regular BCS are like in the nose to me. Nowhere near as sweet smelling has Vanilla was. Very well balanced. 

T-- Wow. All I can say is wow. Bourbon, vanilla, Carmel, chocolate and oak. So soft and creamy. Not very sweet at all. Utterly shocked by this as I hated BCS Vanilla due to the sweetness. Once again the word is balanced. 

M-- Slick and slightly oily. Not that thick but man this is smooth stuff. A bit of an oaked vanilla finish to this. Slight bits of tannins and alcohol to the gums just adds a excellent punch to this. Slight bits of alcohol burn. Utterly Sublime. 

O-- Had been very weary as was not a fan of Vanilla and BCS. This is just insane good. Alcohol is well hidden and this is easy to drink. Takes port to a new level. Honestly an insane good beer. All I really can say is this is mind blowing good. Worthy of the hype and the love this has been given.",0.0,0.9906

Bottle #1,430

A: The beer has a pitch black appearance. The stout is completely opaque with a thin beige head atop the beer. The head recedes after a few short moments, leaving only faint traces of lacing on the glass.

S: The aroma is huge, with the obvious scents of bourbon, roast, and oak.

T: The flavor is fantastic. It was very interesting to taste the evolution of Bourbon County Brand Stout and all of the variants. The Rare version is recognizably smoother and softer on the palate than the regular offering. The bourbon aspect is up front, as one would expect, and melds beautifully with the roast and barrel notes. It seems as though the Pappy Van Winkle barrels make a substantial difference after all.

M: This beer excels in mouthfeel. Thick, rich, and viscous - this beer coats the palate with chocolate and warming alcohol. A very smooth ride, especially given the 13% ABV.

D: A delicious beer, but the $50 price tag is too steep. Great for sharing with your favorite drinking buddies.",0.05590169943749474,0.9835

A: I’m shocked. This is deep black. I great a really nice mocha head from my pour, though, and the legs stick to the glass. Perfect presentation.

N: We drank this after running through an 06-11 vertical, and the nose is definitely PvW. It has a deep oakiness which I’ve only experienced when drinking the bourbon straight. The caramel, vanilla, and coconut also have some extra heft. Chocolate, espresso. 

T: Dark fruits (prunes and raisins) Chocolate. Dismayed by the lack of roast/coffee. Caramel/vanilla. Some residual heat, but it’s gotten to the point of being a nice touch. 

M: Smooth, silky and viscous. 

O: This is really very good when viewed outside of the ridiculous value-inflation of the beer. However, I dare say I’d take the 2009 BCS and the BCS Vanilla over it. The PvW 23 is great to taste in the blend, and it is a deeper flavor, but it’s not a religious experience, either.",0.0,0.9417

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Rare 2010🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/28/2010.  Served on tap in a Black Friday commemorative tasting glass at the GI brewpub. 5 oz. pour. I think the pours were a bit cold, so I allowed it to warm before getting into the glass.

The pour is a midnight black, with a small coffee colored thick creamy foam head on top. Some retention, but no real lacing to speak of. 

The roasted malt, oakiness, and bourbon from the Pappy barrels come through really nicely. The aroma is more pleasant than the regular bourbon county. It is smoother and the difference in the quality of the bourbon barrels is apparent. 

The dark roasted malt and Pappy-soaked oak flavors really blend well, especially with two years of age on it. The smoothness of the taste over time is what really impresses me about this family of beers. Molasses, some smoked tobacco, coffee, and figs come in after it warms up a little bit. These flavors all combine effortlessly in a tasty aged stout.

The feel of the bourbon county stouts is always nice, and this is no exception. It is very thick and creamy, with the body practically squeezing the carbonation out of it. The alcohol is pretty much hidden, quite a feat at 13%.

I liked this a little bit more than the regular bourbon county (accounting for age differential as well), but the price tag is a bit steep.",0.0,0.9841

Just opening the bottle confers the air around you that unforgettable smell.

The barrel notes are so overpowering that there’s barely any roast coming through, or even alcohol.

Imperial Stout With Cacao & Spices Added. 50% Aged In Rum Barrels, 50% Aged In Apple Brandy Barrels.

Alcohol: 11% by volume.

Colour: Black like the eyes of the furious fire god Hun-Hunaphu

Foam: Beige, modest with a finely grained structure.

It hisses loudly and falls to a small stripe. On the edges of the TeKu there are dotted spots.

Smell: There is pulp! The aroma blows to the max. First rum and raisins macerated in this noble drink. Then a whole range of dried fruits, candied apples, plums, apricots and grapes.
Right after that a terrible punch straight in the face from cocoa beans, thick milk chocolate and Belgian pralines.

Knock out provides a range of toffee, coffee, raisins, cane sugar and spices.
Beautiful bouquet!

Taste: Incredible barrel profile. The euphoria of flavors begins with noble rum with its strong and uncompromising taste, full of spices and wood. Then the barrel of apple Brandy (or, I presume, Calvados) enters with great verve, giving the drink a taste of baked apple pie.
The next layers of the bouquet of flavors are an avalanche of chocolate, toffee, Belgian pralines, sugar cane, wood, raisins and toffee.
The final straight belongs to spices, the most distinguished of which is chilli, dotting the ""i"", stinging in the throat.

Alcohol is present, warms, confuses the head a little, but fortunately it does not have a warm, solvent character and does not step out of line.
Double Barrel Hunaphu's has no shortage of body.
The noble, dignified character of the drink will provide many minutes of successful, fruitful tasting.

Carbonation: Low.

Summary:

Finally!! Hunahpu’s (several vintages) - NO! Bourbon Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s - NO!
And only Double Barrel Hunahpu’s - definitely YES!

A wonderful little beer that gives so much joy and satisfaction from tasting!
Deep flavor and aroma profile, stunning Rum and Calvados barrels.
Balance, depth, variety, class and chic.

The best beer in Cigar City Brewing's portfolio!

Rami Rami is drinking a Double Barrel Hunahpu's (2016) by Cigar City Brewing at garwolińska

Cool, tasty, good, interesting, curious, nice. But seriously, it's some kind of very dry roasted vintage, much less barrel than in 2013...

Oxidized, malty, caramel-orange... oh come on... and some long, dull bitterness... a little more stars for the company of the mega pork chop ;)

Aroma of cinnamon, rum, almost a little nutty, some fruity notes and apple. Moderate to heavily sweet with mild bitterness. Lots of cinnamon, caramel, toffee, some chocolate and finishes with a moderate chili burn. You do get some rum barrel sweetness and just a hint of brandy.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"#5000. BIG thanks to digita7693 who generously shared this @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival. The perfect beer for 5000 – one of my biggest wants for 5000 actually – I never thought that I was going to actually try this one. Many thanks for all the great company & beers during the course of all the previous ratings, festivals, tastings etc. Back when I started out trying beers many years ago, I thought that didn’t like beer because all that I knew was pale lager & the occasional Duvel. Tired of always drinking pale lager I decided to try some other beers & for a long time I tried one or two new ones per week at a bar near the university. They had about 40 beers I thought that there must be only about 100 – 200 beers in the world and that outside of Belgium they were all pale lagers. I decided to try nearly all of the beers in the world, as time went on I realized just how wrong I was… Back when I realized just how many beers there were in the world, I thought that trying more like 5000 would be impossible for me over a lifetime,… Turns out I was very wrong. Anyway as for the beer itself…. Deep dark black, looks very viscous, some mocha bubbles but they are quickly gone. Nose is huge thick, spirit-like, huge rum & brandy I suppose, very spirit-like so maybe brandy dominates a big, thick chocolate sludge, warming, chocolate syrup, deep black chocolate, huge oak & spirit presence, almost hot,… Taste is surprisingly cinnamon forward, by far the most of the Hunahpu’s I have tried so far, rich spirit, chocolate syrupy, warming high quality alcohol, black chocolate, very viscous, light espresso, very thick brownie dough, hugely thick & viscous, creamy, warming, thick exotic sugar,… Insanely thick & high quality spirit lingers on afterwards. Impressive, Stranahan still probably remains my favourity. Very happy to have tried one of my biggest wants.",0.036037498507822355,0.9936
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Courtesy of Martinus at Leuven Innovation Beer Festival the first time I had this, big thanks for this one. Almost no head, some loose beige bubbles which quickly disappear (probably because this precious bottle has been opened and resealed over and over again), colour a very dark burgundy, near black. Absolutely wonderful aroma of infinite complexity: a strong perfume of noble chocolate, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon, hint of dried soft chili pepper, espresso, soy sauce, bayleaf, candied dates, old port and old sherry, marzipan, banana liqueur... Truly incredible. Taste is equally amazing, a symphony of candied fruits, slight salty soy sauce accents, sweet marzipan and ’Bounty’ candy coconut plus chocolate, caramel and tons of chocolate fondant, all playing in a thick, heavy, profound texture; finish has more bitter chocolate and fine coffee in store, enriched with a vinous, warming alcohol effect of the finest brandy or single malt you can find, still a very faint hint of chili and peppery hops drying a bit and leaving you flabbergastered as if you just swallowed the most precious liquid ever made. This belongs to the most complex, most rewarding and most satisfying things I ever tasted.  I felt privileged enough being able to taste this whale the first time, but I had double luck in encountering it (from a younger and later batch) a second time at B.U.M.B.A. yesterday - this time adorned with a moussy, pale beige head and with a somewhat 'fresher' aroma, which was so incredibly stunning that I have no choice but to grant this a perfect score.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.

Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, revealing a slick viscosity after swirling, with a hazelnut brown, small head, which soon disappears.
Leaves back alcoholic spider legs, mingling into the darkness of the beer.


Smells of spiced, hot, chocolate, together with a wooden, slightly fruity burn. The scorched malts blend very smoothly into the hot qualities of the beer, both chilies and alcohol. Provides a rich bakers chocolate layer, enriching the unique spiciness, by ending up being a ebenbürtiger, smooth counterpart to them. Brandy exhibits a certain apple fruitiness, which gets picked up by faint lemony tequila, gently wrapped up by cinnamon and chocolate. 

Has an outstandingly smooth mouthfeel, with a lower carbonation, giving the beer enough room to unfold its full, complex body.

Tastes of alcoholic truffels, with a fruity whiff, coated up by cinnamon and chilies. All flavors are very pronounced and well integrated into the overall taste, mainly defined by a decadent mexican chocolate foundation. The beer got a spicy chili bite to it, inviting an alcoholic, wooden flavor to the palate, while both flavors blend flawlessly into each other, providing a unique depth, backed up by ashy chocolate and cinnamon. No booziness hovers above the different, diverse flavors, due to chocolate malts, which are incredible well pronounced, building upa prominent backbone. Finishes with matured, slightly bitter hops, with all other flavors still being recognizable, especially the wooden, part floral, part fruity spirits, which provide a harsh, but pleasant dryness.

This beer is fantastic, its well balanced depth of flavor is far superior to the base beer, with both barrels enriching the flavor. Results in a never before experienced complexity in a spiced imperial stout, with cinnamon being even more present than in the regular version, accentuating the malty chocolate qualities of the beer perfectly. The double burn, due to chilies and spirits, acts as a long lasting, pleasant and well integrated peak, slowly evolving from the luscious chocolate.",0.03666177875533832,0.9906

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Shared by neat people of uncertain identities at a location remote of my dining room. 

The beer pours basically black with a smallish head. There is some sheeting on the glass, for sure. 



The aroma is huge, roasty & oaky with lots of vanilla and chocolate. It’s very sweet smelling with a mild spiciness and some light alcohol. 

Terribly inviting.



The flavor is awfully complex, unknowing that there was any apple brandy barrels involved in the production of this beer I certainly noticed some calvados character to it. It’s remarkably chocolaty and defiantly very sweet (but not without balance) It’s got vanilla, and cinnamon, and a nice warming booziness. The beer is jus over the top in all aspects, and perhaps it’s a touch too sweet and a touch too boozy, but these are easily forgiven given the depth of flavor and the utter richness of the beer.



I hesitate to give this one a 5 on palate, although the sheer thickness and mouth coating syrupy nature of it generally lent my opinion towards that inclination. Over the top is over the top though, and that one luxurious as it is may be pushing excess in the mouthfeel department. 



Really fun beer for sure.

Flavor is similar to the nose, which is excellent. Chocolate, smooth booze, oak, cream, molasses, caramel. One of the best Hunahpu’s variants ever made and right up there with fresh Apple Brandy. Body is full, light perfect carbonation, creamy rich finish.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle. Huge thanks to the local group for sharing this with me. Pours deep black, very dense. Very little head on the pour but still looks awesome. Aroma is ridiculously good. Can smell it from a couple feet away. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, berries, vanilla, cinnamon, soy, and marshmallow. Tastes just as incredible as the aroma. Apple brandy, chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, chocolate syrup, cinnamon, light smokey peppers, and a hint of dried dark fruit. Perfect mouthfeel as well. Very low carbonation makes this extremely smooth and allows the huge flavors to stand out. I’ve had a couple days to think about this beer and I’m convinced it’s the best beer I’ve ever had. My first perfect 5. I would trade many bottles in my cellar to get another one of these.",0.0,0.9881
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, faint molasses, and espresso.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Poured from a bomber into a wine glass. Dark pour, but not motor oil like. Little head. Very boozy aroma (more of brandy than rum) with moderate soy saucey smell. Flavor is terrific, as expected. The beer is quite sweet, but not cloying or overwhelming like dark lord. The blended barrels work well, though I do think the brandy is much more prominent. The chilis are faded a little bit compared to regular Hunahpu but that is to be expected with so much going on. Despite the huge smith of flavors in this beer it has a unified coherent flavor. Really great stuff.",0.0,0.9604
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle broken out a tasting by Douglas. Thanks! 

A: Thick black body, cappuccino head. 

N: Pepper, cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, apple brandy, rum, sugars, chilies. 

T: Sweet as hell, pretty much cloying except for the intense spiciness on the back of the throat. Chocolate and chili is usually good, but I’m not digging this concoction. 

M: Huge body, sticky, oily.

O: A different version of this well known RIS. Like the Apple Brandy variant, it is intense. However, despite the complexity, it’s not actually something I want to drink. It’s just too much, and that doesn’t appeal to me.",0.0,0.8615

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"On tap in Madison, WI

Toppling Goliath has a reputation for excellence which made this the main draw for a night out at one of Madison's best bars. Worth every penny of the cost, it delivers an experience unrivalled by all but the best of the best. Despite the lines I may have to make a detour to their booth at the Great Taste this year to get another pour.

AROMA / APPEARANCE
A deep oily black core permeates the glass and stains everything it touches. A minimal head tracks the long icy legs which melt like sheets of snow on a warm spring day. Plums, raspberry, anise, and coffee hang in the air with a glowing warmth that feels mellow and dense. There's no mistaking the ABV but even so it feels very approachable.

FLAVOR / PALATE
Warm espresso, dark chocolate, plums, and blackberries coat the palate with layers of boozy sediment. The dense flavors complement each other so well that it is nearly effortless to follow each sip with another. The mildly bitter finish continues to warm the throat well after the glass is empty. Overall there is only one complaint - that I did not order a full pour when offered the opportunity.",0.0,0.989

Imperial Stout Brewed With Maple Syrup & Coffee. 

Alcohol: 12% vol. 

IBU: 50 

Color: Black, opaque. 

Foam: You can't find fault with anything here. Beige, high, lush, compact foam. 
It stands in one place for a long time as if enchanted. 
After emptying the glass, it still remains on its walls. 

Smell: The aroma is massive! It spreads in a wide arc over the entire room and fills it with its intensity. 
You don't have to put your nose to the bottle to feel the gigantic scent of maple syrup supported by the best quality coffee. 
Only minimal roastiness combined with notes of Belgian pralines, caramel and leading vanilla. 
Despite the fact that the beer is a classic Imperial, the aroma crushes most of the best barrel RISs I've had.
I think that they should invent an additional aroma scale for beers like this.
Poetry!

Taste: Pleasant maple syrup dominates the tongue.
Thick, fragrant, fresh.
It brings to mind the best pancakes covered in maple syrup that I once ate in Las Vegas in

one of the American breakfast bars.

After a while, coffee comes to the fore, which starts to dominate after the second sip.

A light roastiness and low acidity immediately place this beer among the best coffee RISs in my portfolio.

The taste is complemented by accents of dark and milk chocolate, molasses, vanilla, Belgian pralines, caramel, cinnamon and marzipan.
Thick, oily and whipped like pudding texture. Percentages masterfully swept under the carpet.
Full, sweet, silky and creamy on the tongue. At the end of the tasting, after a solid warming in the hands, a minimal coffee sourness appears on the tip of the tongue. It does not affect the final reception of the drink in any way.

Excellent work! 

Carbonation: Low. 

Summary: 

Mornin' Delight - the beer with which I enter 2018. 

2nd best Imperial Stout in the world. 

Perfection, excellence and a masterful understanding of the subject. 

This is truly an Imperial Stout that reflects the American climate in 100s. 

The additives added to the beer: maple syrup and coffee perfectly emphasize what is an important element of their lives for Americans. 
The balance of the individual components is simply incredible. 
Pampered to the limits of possibility, from the packaging, through appearance, and ending with taste. 
Rich, multi-layered, it will remain in my memory for a long time. 
It's not my No. 1,
but it will definitely be in my Top 10 Imperials.

The mouthwatering promises made by the aroma are perfectly met by the flavour, kicking off with thick sweet maple syrup embellished with dried fruit notes and a thin sourish accent, blending in well with the caramelly, toffeeish and profoundly nutty, big, oily malt body, perfectly (i.e. softly) carbonated fit for this style. The nuttiness shifts colours to a darker, bitter black 'chocolateness', bitterly toasty yet not overly roasted: the creaminess of the maple syrup lies a perfectly measured layer of soothing sweetness on top of it, and the no doubt copious amounts of coffee that went in here, provide delightful retronasal aromas and a refined, spicy, delicate and warm roastedness that is more expressive and vivid than the actual roasted barley. Ends with vanilla- and cinnamon-like accents, very rich, a coffee dessert with alcohol - which takes on a long, heating, brandy-like quality, yet at the same time completely avoids obnoxious wryness. Tasted this next to a 2015 vintage as well, which was just as rich and ravishingly beautiful, yet a tad softer and more rounded, a bit less sharp in terms of solvents and a little bit less aromatically coffee-ish - but these were 'microscopic' differences due to age alone, presumably. Well, now that I finally had a taste of this nectar of the gods: not sure if this is the single best stout I ever had - but it comes very, very close. Then again, the whole hype surrounding this beer, one of these artificially mystified beers (admittedly largely due to geeks like ourselves here, ironically perhaps), should not matter in judging this: any experienced taster with a basic technical knowledge will be able to assess that this is a work of great beauty, class and craftmanship. A huge, detailed and completely flawless construction of flavours, the essence of American-style RIS with maple syrup and coffee dosed in such a way that they actually accentuate the features of this beer in a tastefully balanced way rather than overpowering them.  Unforgettable, and I was over the moon when given the chance to sample it again - from tap - at Billie's Craft Beer Fest 2023, when it was oddly much smoother, more caramelly and more milk-chocolatey - yet still utterly delicious.  My rating here is an average of both encounters with this highly coveted stout.",0.0686802819743445,0.9985

Maple syrup, maple taffy on snow, uncooked chocolate chip cookie dough... Real madness! Once in my glass, however, the aromas fade curiously quickly. Much more maple vapor escapes from my glass than from Marc-André’s glass. I still smell a lot of chocolate but especially coffee. A green base, however, makes me raise my eyebrows because the latter was the last thing I expected. Coffee remains at the center of all the action - on the nose as well as in the mouth. Aromas of heated Ethiopian coffee beans accentuated by exceptional quality milk chocolate chips. And that texture!!! The liquid is light as a feather, even airy. A satiny lightness, soft as I have never felt anything like it. The maple greets me as it passes by as a reminder, leaving the chocolate and coffee to compete for the leading role.

Toppling Goliath Mornin' Delight🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Mornin delight batch 2

Pours an oily, black color, with a medium, dark brown head to it, revealing huge bubbles within a spongy head. Coates the side of the glass after swirling with alcohol legs, small bubbles and an oily film, showcasing the thickness of the beer.

Smells of warming syrup, wrapped up by cold pressed coffee beans, together with scorched, earthy malts. Atop of that foundation settles a nutty and raisiny quality, both adding to the potent coffee appearance. Milk chocolate enriches the luscious, sweet maple syrup, with coffee cutting through in a flowery, slightly wooden fashion. The most beautiful thing about the aromas is their perfect balance in combination to its outstanding intensity. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, soft on the tongue with a lower carbonation to it, presenting the beers huge body perfectly. Even its profound coffee bitterness during the finish is not able to distract from its creamy softness, maintaining its fantastic thickness.

Tastes of oaken, multi layered espresso bean, pungent, while offering a pleasant, mellowing sweetness, which gets beautifully enhanced by the syrup. An early, dry coffee bitterness goes hand in hand with earthen, toasted malts and a brewed coffee sourness, almost completely wrapped up by the malts. Into this coffee sourness blends the rich maple syrup, creating an intriguing flavor depth, soothed by whipped cream. During the beers finish, its profound coffee earthiness returns to the palate, while bitter chocolate compliments it, together with perfumy, alcohol soaked praline.

While featuring chewy, sweeter qualities, the beer reveals an awesome balance, due to its mvp, the coffee. It is incredibly rich and exhibits both, sweeter and bitter qualities by itself, accentuated by syrup and malts. Its mouthfeel makes this truly great, maintaining a remarkable silkness on the tongue, while the beers rich, thick body is challenging the tastebuds throughout, in the most pleasant way, coating my tongue for minutes after each sip.",0.11258799375612022,0.9972

The flavor is rich & sweet, generally huge with a bunch of dark chocolate & coffee. It seems a bit odd, but I swear I got a touch of like a floral bitterness to it too, I’m not sure what that’s about,, but it was nice enough either way and provided not so much a balance, but a curious pleasant note that took the beer in a slightly less brooding direction.

Imperial Stout with Neapolitan ice cream treatment.

Smell: There is real magic in the aroma! Inspired by Neapolitan ice cream, absolutely spot on. Just like in the picture on the label - the layers of beer are distributed in exactly the same way. First, deep, top quality Swiss chocolate, along with cocoa and molasses. Then no less intense vanilla, sweet dessert, constituting the central core of the drink.

Finally, strawberry yogurt, ice cream with strawberry pieces and a shake of the same flavor. All 3 levels interpenetrate each other, creating a coherent whole.

Taste: The taste is truly speechless. The most beautiful and delicious dessert in the world.

Liquid chocolate with admixtures of almond nuts, light coffee, molasses and cocoa beans.
A lot of vanilla cookies and ice cream.
Strawberry is somewhere there. There is no problem in catching it between the individual layers.

The texture is thick and oily. No alcohol notes.

The lovely scents of strawberries/vanilla/chocolate all waft up from the snifter along with a tiny bit of roast malt.

The proper components are all there -- it really does taste remarkably like a Neapolitan ice cream sandwich -- with a creamy vanilla and slightly boozy finish. Thick, syrupy mouthfeel.

4/5 Overall: I'm a big fan of sherry, however sherry matured Zenne y Frontera always frustrated me. For B5 I got typical Fino characters instead of Oloroso and PX, however it's still enjoyable, anyway. Unfortunately, the prestigious B1 disappointed me. It's very unlike lambic to be so spicy on nose while openning, meanwhile the sherry infulences(I was expecting tons of dried fruits, nuts and coffee chocolate characters from those 40 year old Oloroso and PX sherry casks) were still hard to identify, despite the spiceness could be recognized as Oloroso. It's quite decent on mouth in absolute terms, however inappropriate to it's price and championship nowadays. The bottle looks well kept, so I wonder why this was such overhyped. I am a sherry enthusiast, but the ZF range of overhyped sherry casks has always confused me. For example, B5 tasted Fino instead of Oloroso and PX, but it was pleasant nonetheless. Unfortunately, the well-known B1 let me down. The spice that stole the show on opening the bottle made it smell very un-Lambic, while the sherry flavors were still hard to discern (I was expecting a lot of nuts, coffee and chocolate from the barrel-aged 40-year-old Oloroso and PX sherries), although the spice could be considered to be from Oloroso sherry. In absolute terms, this wine tastes really good, but it is obviously not commensurate with its high price and status today. This bottle looks to be in very good condition, which makes me wonder how this wine is so hyped up.

Shared with Jan of Weerspannige Brouwers. Medium thick, moussy, densely packed, pale yellowish white, lightly lacing, very stable head over a misty peach blonde beer with light orange hue. Complex and extremely elegant bouquet of gooseberry, unripe melon, lime juice, fermenting hay, wet wood, dry sherry indeed but well integrated into the whole, cava, moldy lemon peel, slight vanilla (oak?), unripe pear, mandarin peel, yoghurt, stale sweat but subtly so, passion fruit. Rich estery onset full of gooseberry, redcurrant, unripe plum and passion fruit, tart with a sweetish edge somewhere, champagne-like carbonation just fit for the style; soft lemony acidity (’mals’) and sedate lactic sourishness dominate the whole and dry the palate but again in an extremely elegant, ’friendly’ and softish kind of way, over a backbone of bready barley and soapy, deeply sourish wheat. Mouthfeel is soft and creamy, more ’moelleux’ than usual for a geuze. Passion fruit and gooseberry tartness persist towards the finish, pairing up with a brief but well-placed earthy ’old’ hop bitterish touch and drying, noble woodiness, bearing a sherry accent which blends in perfectly with the natural oloroso-like features of the lambic; a genuine sherry flavor subtly lingers in the back of the mouth after swallowing while the soft lambic tartness persists. A very subtle vanilla-like sweetish accent pops up too distinguishing this from other geuzes, along with the subtle sherry accent. In all, however, this sherry factor is just a touch of colour, rather than a dominant flavor imposed on it - I can easily see how this got its reputation and raving scores here. This is among the most elegant, noble and ’aristocratic’ lambic beers I ever had the pleasure to taste, it really doesn’t get much better than this. What a masterpiece... I’m even inclined to purchase another bottle for the same price and keep it in the cellar for some years. The perfect geuze, perhaps?",0.041030496993110906,0.9974

As it warmed up, the funk took over and it became a smooth, more classic Geuze. Really outstanding, very complex stuff! Score: 10 / 4 / 9 / 4 / 18",0.11952286093343935,0.9918

Pale, honey-tangerine colored body shows high clarity and an off-white head that is large but falls rapidly to cover/ring.
After decanting this bad boy, the first aroma notes are all sherry. Nutty, earthy, woody and with a bit of anise, it’s much more given to the sherry, than lambic. But after about 30 minutes, things start to get very interesting...Gone is the hard, nutty, nearly papery sherry character and in it’s place is a ton of funky brett, with lime, hickory nut skin, band aid and black pepper. Sherry notes become more vinous, oily and leathery, still retaining the nuttiness but becoming softer; much softer. Light vanilla, honey and a hint of tobacco, perhaps? Seems like you could sit and sniff this stuff, as it evolves, for hours....
The flavor is bright, full of brett, with perfectly integrated sherry notes of butter toffee, orange blossom honey and pecan. Acidity adds balance without overpowering and a delicate, wondrous balance is achieved. Malty-soft texture with low, but tight carbonation and no alcohol or flaw. Lingering orange blossom, honey-cashew and lambic-derived acidity. Stunning.

Rich buttered bread, almond, cashew, zippy sherry-like grape acidity on the end. Funk, Brett, mild lactic acidity.

Pours darker than a regular Lambic, possibly resulting from the Sherry barrels, with a a dark orange, almost brown color and a nice, fluffy head.

The aromas are full of toasty cherry pits and dusty, moldy oak with a well nuanced, boozy hint to it, gently balanced by a blend of fruity cherries and crisp lemon peel. Cherries got a profound sugary sweetness coming from the barrel, almost a little spicy at its peak, convincingly toned down by the wooden barrel. Got a yellow grape acidity and ripeness to it, lending an additional layer of matured, fermented fruit sweetness to the nose.

Has a lower carbonation with a velvet, fuller mouthfeel featuring a great interplay of the Cherry barrel and 3F’s typical bright funky- and sourness.

Tastes of a mineral, stony beginning, inviting old cherry pits to the palate, which got a toasty, sugar glazed quality to them. A sour undertone takes up on the cherry flavor and adds crisp lemon peel to it, enhancing its appearance without getting exceedingly acidic at any point. The barrel also adds musty, wooden funk with a fermented wine characteristic to the taste, showcasing the bigger body of this. Reveals a sour, fermented Cherry taste with lots of wood and flowery citrus - sour and dry, while staying surprisingly fruity during the finish. 

Probably the most complex Lambic I’ve had so far. Armand did create a blend no one else thought of, and he did it tremendously well. All flavors, led by the prominent Cherry barrel, blend harmoniously together, showcasing an amazing interplay of wood, funk, sweet and sour. Everything you could wish for in a Lambic, you’ll find it here.",0.0,0.9902

3 Fonteinen Zenne y Frontera🇧🇪Lambic -  Unblended Jonge / Oude,"Several tasting glasses, all decanted, during the open days at 3F.

Orange color remaining quite clear, creamy and persistent off-white neck.
Aroma immediately offers a certain intensity of barrel which highlights the complexity of the PX. This bouquet is thick and combines the distinct bouquet of Sherry with the bouquet of lambic, namely finely lemony scents, a note of sourness which remains quite minimal.

On the palate, I am also taken by surprise by the intensity of the product. The whole remains marked at 7% and seems to appear more. The profile keeps a certain dry length of the lambics which softens with the maturation in these barrels to offer a clever blend between a lambic with funk (light), lemony, leathery and light earthy contents with the woodiness of the Sherry which gives a little hazelnut side, hint of vanilla and light vinousness. At the end, I still note a hint of sourness that creeps into this warm profile and reminds me that I am at Pajotenand.

The evolving profile of the carafe - Armand spoke of decantation but I did not see this when pouring the bottles despite the presence of the candle and what about the possible deposit? - was already marked during my 2nd glass which was filled with a freshly decanted Zenne. The profile as well as the bouquet were not as open as the 1st.

An exceptional product that will certainly find, and given its price, its audience and whose cost can be a subject of debate. It is clearly not for all budgets, and we must hope that the uninitiated wine connoisseurs to whom this product seems to be aimed will make the transition to this beer and the tables of great restaurants. We are already moving away from the attractive side that makes beer a product available to everyone but which is nevertheless worth tasting, which is what open days allow us to do.",0.0,0.9867

Small lacing on the glass,

Taste: The first sip and a smile immediately appears on my face. What a cutie!

Untamed sweetness of vanilla ice cream, coconut cookies, Bounty, almonds, caramel, marzipan and Belgian pralines.

The next sips are more layers of milk chocolate, cocoa, molasses and quite distinct, roasted coffee.

A bloody intense bourbon barrel, which brings endless layers of vanilla, coconut and delicate oak wood.

The texture of the drink amazes with its density and oiliness.

It is rare to find such incredibly full, ultra-sweet and sticky barrel-aged Imperial Stouts.
You can't even feel the alcohol in the slightest.

The Lord melts smoothly and velvetily on the walls of the mouth and on the palate.

Summary:

I have been looking for Bourbon Dark Lord in the USA for a long time. I traveled across the vast expanses of American prairies, deserts, forests, lakes and oceans to finally find my little ""beer grail"".

I'm glad I managed to get my hands on the 2017 version.

The base from that year made a huge impression on me.

The bourbon barrel, or rather a blend of different bourbon barrels (including Woodford Reserve and Heaven Hill) raised this drink to an incredibly high level. The intensity of barrel vanilla and coconut is incredible.
The variety of ingredients is another prime asset of this drink.
""Florida sugars"" can compete with the sweetness of this drink.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"On tap at FWIBF. Pours a pitch black hued body with a lasting tan head. Aromas are dark fruit, milk chocolate, bourbon, fudge, dusty, ashy, mineral and a lot of alcohol. Flavors are surprisingly smooth, milk chocolate, barrel, fudge, vanillin and tannin. The barrel character seems to cut into the sweetness. Velvety mouthfeel, creamy, viscous. Insanely good mouthfeel. I was expecting to dislike this, especially on such a hot day. I haven’t liked the sweetness of the newer batches of DL, and have not been wild about the barrel treatments, but this definitely surpassed my expectations.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle 656/688

Black pour with a thin light brown collar. Thick oily residue left in the glass. Very thick ABV legs

Nose is dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon, wood, chocolate, caramel,coconut, and subtle soy sauce. Some alcohol but well subdued. Fruits really stand out well.

Might as well just copy and paste the above remarks. Barrel really shines in this beer and hides what makes Dark Lord a meh beer. Dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla, coconut, caramel and other fun notes. 

Thick and coating. Low carbonation, big body, well balanced. ABV is there but it is later that it catches up to me. 

Bad ass beer. One of the best bourbon treatments I have had.

taste is ... sweetness ( sugary from the dark lord) bourbon ( damn much of it ! ) vanilla, caramel, syrupy comes to mind, even though i dont think this is very thick in substance, its just very heavy in the stomach ( to me that it, maybe i shouldnt have drank this after so many other goodies) 
the alcohol is definetly there, but not TOO much. carbo is very low ( gotta love that) overall a very sweet, maximized bourbon taste kind of beer. not realy my thing ( as expected ) yet i stil REALY wanted to try this ( the fuzz thats going on, and lets face it, i can no longer denie i like to hunt a whale now and than :p ) it kinda lives up to my expectations, but its also nothing more than that.

I shared this bad boy at the Star Wars tasting. 750 ml waxed bottle, 567/688, served in a Deschutes tulip.

A: Pours a dark black color, viscous like motor oil. A nice ring mocha foam is left over after the pour. As it recedes and swishes around there is some nice legs and splotchy lace left behind.

A: Bourbon up front with some dark fruits. smooth oak, some caramel, milk chocolate sweetness and nice toasted malts.

T: Nice barrel presence right away. Smooth bourbon, smoked oak, caramel and light vanilla. Sweet chocolate, some fudge and roasted malts. Toasted marshmallow as well. Very well integrated.

M: Thick and chewy. Medium to low carbonation. So smooth and it goes down with some slight heat.

O: This is drinking really, really well right now. No harsh booze and the barrel is just integrated very well. My personal favorite of the day.

2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord.

Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldn’t ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as ""oil slick in the gulf"" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.

The flavor is so complex and and layered, with one smell/flavor coming one after the next; the layering is so incredible. So full bodied that your mouth feels sticky afterwards, but so tasty too. It is an extraordinary beer. However, I wish it could be aged, because after drinking an aged normal bottle of DL compared to an unaged bottle of normal, there is such a difference. If only I could have this whenever I wanted...",0.07412493166611012,0.9294
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"A: The pour is viscous and black with just a bit of tan foam around the edge of the glass.

S: A definite oak and bourbon presence to the nose without the intense sweetness Dark Lord usually has. Certainly some sweet chocolate and vanilla with a bit of dark fruits.

T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.

M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.

D: I like this one much better than Dark Lord. The oak aging here has helped to balance the beer out and mitigate the overwhelming sweetness.",0.0,0.8678

I received this pour as I schlepped my bottles of Dark Lord  through the brewery.  I savored this sample for the next 30-45 minutes, as I made my way through the crowds.  The pour was thick and brown-black like molasses.  The aroma was intoxicating, with a faint whiff of alcohol, coffee, dried fruit, and caramel.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Rating #1000.  Draft at Dark Lord Day 2010, shawnm213 was nice enough to pick up a handful of these for our crew.  Thanks again, Shawn!  I didn’t have to wait in line for it.  I switched it over from the plastic cup to my Duvel glass, not that it was going to make a huge difference.  Pours a super dark brown; I didn’t see the pour itself to appreciate the motor oil stream that the Dark Lord normally demonstrates, but it sat in the glass opaque, with nice rich brown highlights on the edges and a little brown head.  Damn near perfect on aroma and flavor.  Notes of rich dark chocolate and creamy milk chocolate, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, brown sugar, peat, and incredible oak and bourbon notes from the Woodford Reserve barrel.  Not much vanilla came through for me, but the wood seems to be mellowing the sweetness of the normal Dark Lord.  Low carbonation, and a smooth, rich, woody, oily mouthfeel.  Full-bodied, though Shawn and Mike are saying this is thinner than last year’s version because it uses the 2009 vintage and not the 2008; I’ll buy that, having done a 5-year DL vertical with them, and that’s probably the only thing keeping this from being a perfect 5 for me- well, and the plastic cup.  It’s so close, though; this is one of the best things I’ve ever tasted. Re-Rate: 2012 release, bottle 505/688. It’s a little sweeter and not as good as the 2011 version, which I tried a few nights earlier and confirmed my rating. The 2012 is still amazing stuff but wouldn’t rate as highly.",0.18814417367671943,0.9941
Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Served on tap at the FFF brewpub on DLD. I was fortunate enough to get a seat at the bar to sample the 2 big one-offs. The oak aged poured a high gloss midnight black with no real head (This were being pre-poured so any head that was there had not lasted.) The aromas pour out of the glass with heavy bourbon, almost as strong a a glass of the Woodford Reserve on the rocks. The flavors are also overpowered with the bourbon initially. Loads of rich roasted malts, vanilla, espresso, chocolate.  As the beer continued to warm the bourbon subsides more and more (or intoxicates more and more). It is truly a shame that this isn’t bottled because an extra year mellowing out the bourbon and letting the complexities to continue to grow would make this brew even more out of this world.

Maybe I was a little drunk when I had this (ok, let’s change that ""maybe"" to a ""definitely""), but this one really stopped me in my tracks and made me appreciate just what the hell I was drinking: one of the greatest beers of all time!

Pours as black as the BeerAdvocate website background, and as thick as Aunt Jemima syrup. A well-formed brown head sits on top and leaves some lacing on the glass...er...plastic cup.

The nose on this one is out of this world. So much going on. It smells like a rich chocolate cake, along with coffee, roastiness, candied fruits, oak, and bourbon. Even puts regular Dark Lord to shame here.

Flavor is similarly amazing. The sweetness of Dark Lord really mellows out with the oak aging. Lots of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and candied plums and raisins. Oak and bourbon blend seamlessly and do not overwhelm in the least bit.

Incredibly full-bodied and rich on the palate. Carbonation level is medium-low, exactly as appropriate for a beer like this.

Overall, wow, this is unbelievably good. I’ll knock it down a half-point on the drinkability just because it’s so overwhelming, but as drunk and full as I was, I had no problem taking down the 6oz pour. (Wish it hadn’t been so easy!)

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"I’ve had this two years in a row in a plastic cup pour. I took some brief notes this year, so here it goes - a lot of this will be complementary to my review of Dark Lord (when I finally get around to reviewing the regular variety). Some of this text is borrowed from my Vanilla-bean review, where appropriate.

A - Think quick-dissolving mocha foam, nice ring of lace, pitch black with a hint of red at the edges. It’s about all I expect from a 13% RIS.

S - Oak-barrel, but not the stupid amount I experienced in oak-aged Behemoth. There’s also a touch of vanilla and almond that I get from most good barrel-aged brews, plus the cadre of ""regular"" Dark Lord smells. It’s different from regular Dark Lord, but not a huge improvement.

T - I found the oak-aging to simplify the taste of Dark Lord in a way that wasn’t altogether positive. The oak-aging really brings out the booziness and heat and smooths out a lot of the really interesting flavors from the regular Dark Lord. It’s still pretty delicious, but just slightly acerbic.

M - Thick, near milk-shake consistency, with tons of residual stickiness, and low carbonation. This is the way RISes should be down - other brewer’s take note.

D - This is a mild step in the wrong direction - takes the least drinkable elements of Dark Lord and amplifies them a little bit. It’s hot, palate-beating, and not really much more interesting than the regular variety. Worth trying, but not worth waiting hours in line to try.",0.0,0.9718

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Nip handbottle, courtesy StFun. Pours completely pitch black, thick and viscous looking with a tiny patch of dark brown bubbles at the head. There is no lace, though the sheeting practically stains the glass brown. The aroma is absolutely incredible. Vanilla bean creme brûlée immediately comes to mind, as do notes of softened whiskey and oak, all atop an already decadent blend of burnt caramel, chocolate cake, and mocha cafe. Hints of licorice and anise lend ample spice, completing the near-perfect  nose. The flavor has the nearly impossible task of living up to the beautiful scents that eminate from the glass, and accordingly, it falls a bit short.  Still delicious, and based in rich chocolate, caramel, and roasty coffee, the sharpness of the whiskey barrel and the anise tends to come across on the boozy side. Sweet, scorched marshmallow works nicely with the vanilla laden, toasted oak barrel notes. Very faintly carbonated (though that is no doubt the handbottle talking), the palate is dense and oily, ever so slightly thinned as compared to the base beer. Coffee, anise, and bourbony wood intensify on the sharp finish. Though the barrel influence changes the character of the brew considerably, it remains signature Dark Lord through and through.

A: Pours as dark as night, flat pitch black with only a bubble or two for a head. The beer is thick, dense, it literally coats the glass.

S: Huge vanilla aromas, from the wood I guess. Nothing artifical about the vanilla though, it is like creamy buttery vanilla. The wood component is huge as well. Like fresh cut oak. Strong roasty notes are there along with hints of molasses and chocolate.

T: Holy Hell! There is nothing like this beer. It is the king of barrel aged beers in my mind without a doubt. Fudge like chocolate up front along with a big blast of roast. The oak component is huge and so enjoyable. Vanilla manages to push through with hints of bourbon. A slight milky coco puffs flavor can be picked up as well. Simple flavors that seem to just meld together perfectly. Really is a perfect beer.

Sour flavor still has ton of tons of fruit, incredible depth, slightly bitter arsenic/rubber that grows with warmth, high co2 bitterness, acidity high but soft and supremely jammy through the lightly watery finish, would prefer a stickier end but this is absolutely delicious.

What better beer to celebrate someone’s birthday and another milestone (2900 ratings) than a new rating from the mind of Dan Carey? A world class sour beer, I am glad I have another tucked away in the cellar. It has held up well this last year though if you have any reason at all to crack it open with friends then enjoy this before the next one hits in a few weeks.



Aroma / Appearance - A deep ruby red base sticks to the glass with little effort. Flat with no obvious carbonation this has the vibe of an aged lambic. Blackberries, aggressive vinegar, and other acidic aspects are almost as sharp as a bottle of vintage La Folie. Despite that the fruitiness keeps it from being just a sour bottle of salad dressing.



Flavor / Palate - Blackberry syrup and vinegar poured over a fresh pie fills the mouth with a chewy texture. Not content to just scour the palate clean it then lingers in the throat like an army of scrubbing bubbles leaving a sour mark behind. There are no flaws to be found with this except that the bottle is only 500 ml. Once again New Glarus has proven that they are seldom mistaken with a recipe. I can’t wait to try the 2014 sour in just a few weeks.",0.0,0.9666

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry🇺🇸Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored,"3 oz pour at bottle share, thanks Shea!
Appearance: Light foam which left slight trails around the glass. Dark purple coloration reminiscent of blackberry juice. Very inviting.
Aroma: Wow. One of the most aromatic beers I have ever enjoyed. Big blackberry aroma wafts out of the glass. There’s no synthetic smell here, its as if hundreds of blackberries were freshly squeezed and jammed into the bottle!
Taste: The flavor progression on this sour is both amazing and surprising. You get an obscenely fresh blackberry flavor on the front while the tartness builds through the middle and climaxes on the finish. In contrast, many sours which I have had blast you with sour on the start and give the fruit flavor on the finish. The sour finish is fairly intense, reminiscent of warhead candy. This flavor is so fresh and spot on I actually had the sensation of phantom blackberry seeds!
Palate: Medium body, very effervescent, bubbly all the way down the palate.
Overall: This is hands down my favorite sour that I have ever had. I was heartbroken when I reached the end of my pour. I just kept breathing in the (still extremely pungent!) aroma from the last vestiges of this sweet nectar of the gods. Well done New Glarus, well done.",0.0,0.9828

New Glarus R & D Sour Fruit - Wild Blackberry🇺🇸Sour / Wild Beer - Flavored,"So the carbonation problem has resolved itself; New Glarus asked to hold on to these for a couple months to fully carbonate, and it did. A soft pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a glass filling, four-finger thick, pink head that has me sucking down foam so that it doesn’t over flow; the foam tastes incredibly tart, with a hugely floral, over-ripe berry fruit character. The beer went into the fridge yesterday with a beer you could see through even through the brown glass; today, through the glass the beer shows a bunch of chill haze. The beer is a murky, dark cherry color that shows a deeply hazed, lighter cherry hue when held up to the light. The foam has a lot of structure to it, and sticks to the sides of my glass quite thickly. The rich, tart, dark fruit character is incredibly bright and dominant here; it reminds me of dark, complex cherries, and raspberries. This is supported by light notes of grassy, perhaps seed derived, fruit character, perhaps a hint of musty phenolics in the finish, and when you really dig for it, just a hint of plastic / medicinal like character in the long finish.



I made the mistake of giving my wife a sip of this, and she immediately demanded to have me pour some in her own glass. The beer is tart up front, and doesn’t let up through the finish; the tartness gets a touch harder, with a bit more sour edge towards the middle and finish, and it gets mixed in with a medicinal note that reminds me of something like cherry-flavored children’s aspirin. The fruit character is definitely dominant here, and provides notes of dark, sour cherries (leans towards the richness in Schaerbeekse type cherries), incredibly floral (fruity rose and carnation notes), and dark, concentrated raspberry notes. A bit of nutty malt like character comes through after a bit and adds a nice bit of complexity that is not fruit related. Touches of berry seed like notes, meld with a nutty, slightly woody oak character in the finish. A fresh, berry like pulp character is noticeable towards the finish, it really reminds me of chewing on the ripest (though not sweet), incredibly floral and expressive, blackberries one could imagine. The body is nice and rich, yet light and soft at the same time, just as a good Lambic often achieves. The sourness here can be quite biting at times, it definitely leans towards making this a sipping beer. The oak and berry flavors in this beer definitely provide an astringency and bite to the finish as well, though it is more rounded than the bite from the sourness.



This really does approach the richness of the better thought of fruit Lambics; it has the über-fresh, concentrated fruit jam character of a Lou Pepe, or 3F Schaerbeekse, and it is drier, yet still satisfying. This is far better than I was expecting, though it doesn’t have the complexity that I like in a Lambic, though to be fair, New Glarus has not called this a Lambic, and those super fruit bombs from 3F and Cantillon are low on the Lambic flavors as they get drowned out on the fruit for the most part (though not entirely). Really nice, and I wish this was easy enough to get that I had a couple of these in the cellar to enjoy.",0.05060453993692574,0.9967

Lemon and some tangy grapefruit notes, red wine, hints of oak and vanilla. There’s certainly some earthiness and funk going on, tough the fruit and acidity remain at the focus throughout the taste.

T: Not as jammy on the taste, but it it is still there. Ultra fresh blackberries with some nice under ripe berry tartness. Oaky with slight vanilla sweetness to it. Light, bready malts with a nice blackberry sourness.

M: medium to light bodied with a spritzy carbonation level. Effervescence on the tongue.

Pours a deep ruby crimson hue, deep seedy berry, good haziness with sizable pinkish red hue atop. Dies to a firm layer, laces well enough. Sticks around as a decent layer. Deep dark body of good berry glow, blackberry and raspberry pulp. Aromas are just heavenly. Rich seedy blackberry, raspberry, and gentle cherry. Pulpy and juicy, memories of Southampton BRL come immediately flowing back. Lemony lactic twang, seedy berry, and yogurt. Some gentle funk works in as it settles and warms. Decent tannic oak hits the nostrils. Very impressive fruit presence, pretty sour on the nose. Initial is firmly sour, not overdone. Lactic and blackberry elements are firm, seedy and yogurt presence. Ripe and pulpy raspberry, oak, and gentle funk. A mellow carbonation in the body, a bit soft but still tart. Time should do this well. Middle is fruity, seedy, a bit more acidity hits but nothing that would be considered overwhelming. A bit prickly still with a firm fruit base. Gentle oak grows, mellow yogurt. Twangy lactic and berry elements mingle firmly. A bit more fruity, gentle berryskin and sugars into the backend. Some time and age will dry this out a bit more, up the carbonation to a really nice level I think. Really nice beer right now, potent but not overdone sourness. A bit flat into the backend and finish as it tapers out, still leaves a firm blackberry presence, seedy with mellow cobwebs, oak, and barnyard. Really see some time upping that backend experience. As it stands, it’s rich and has some really nice elements, especially it’s nose, appearance, and front end. Backend is more like a New Glarus fruit beer but a bit more tart, mellow carbonation.

Up close all I can think of when I smell it is macerated blackberries and raspberries. Very sweet and fresh fruit fragrance. As told, it is very fruity with some cranberry and lemon flesh tartness and a whisper of funk. The flavor is much more tart than the nose would indicate.

My first impression is that this tastes a *lot* like Pliny the Elder with more bitterness in the finish.  It looks like that beer with a clear light amber body but almost no head at all.  The bitterness has some citrus rind but it's quite vegetal in nature although not overpowering like some IPAs.  It reminds me a bit of the hop flavor in Sierra Nevada's Hoptimum.   Good balancing sweetness and it's very drinkable at 10.25% ABV.  The hops really dig in all the way around the tongue and stay put long after the sip is over.

Overall
It is said that this was a QDH TIPA. There were signs which suggested that this beer was a hugely improved version of DDH PTE - sweetness, floral, corn, ripe fruits, refreshing bitterness, etc. The improvement is mainly about the mouthfeel - such thick and creamy, without any peppery pungency. This beer is extremely easy drinking and enjoyable, especially for sweet enthusiasts. A redefinition of West Coast IPA!

Best Triple IPA in the world according to Untappd: 4.66

Alcohol: 10.25% by volume

IBU: 90

Canning date: 03.02.2021

The most sought-after IPA in the world. Referred to as Double IPA by RateBeer. Referred to as Triple IPA by Untappd. 
First released in 2005!
Until last year, the beer was available only on tap at the brewery in Santa Rosa, one day a year, in February. Long lines of beer geeks waited for hours to try this masterpiece. Last year and this year, the owners of the brewery, married couple Natalie and Vinnie Cilurzo, decided to bottle Pliny. 
In 2021, a new hop - Elixir - joined the wide range of hops. 

Pliny the Younger is poured with a white, fluffy as snow foam, which slowly slides down, leaving a moderate amount of discs. 
The color is golden, clean, clear. 
After removing the branded cap, you can feel the strength and intensity of the hops. It smells phenomenal - resin, pine needles, forest, an avalanche of citrus fruits, of which oranges and tangerines are the most noticeable. Pleasant maltiness, followed by minimal floral notes. After warming in the hands, even more resinous details. 
The taste bursts with intensity, and at the same time surprises with the lightness and smoothness of the experience. 
Intensely coniferous, forest with elements of pine needles. The power of citrus: tangerines, grapefruits, oranges sealed with elements of pineapple. Specific bitterness, but not overwhelming in any way.
A masterful balance. Powerful and compact body. Sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet, sometimes citrusy, sometimes floral, sometimes resinous. All combined into an unforgettable image.

A perfect, unforgettable experience.

Russian River Pliny the Younger🇺🇸IIPA DIPA - Imperial / Double IPA,"Arguably the most sought-after IPA in the world, the almost mythical offspring of Russian River's legendary Pliny the Elder, created in 2005 as a superlative to the Elder in a sense - effectively creating 'triple IPA' as a genre, even if double IPA and triple IPA are obviously a continuum and both are regarded as one single category on this site.  Hopped with Amarillo, Chinook, Citra, Mosaic, Simcoe and more - a complete line-up of famed New World hop varieties, in other words.  Originally released as a winter seasonal and so far only made available from tap in the two tasting rooms of the brewery each year in February, but thank the beer gods that the Cilurzos decided to try and bottle it this year - enabling it to travel, with so far one single bottle having reached Belgium, a bottle I was very honoured to get a sample of.  If, among all those famous and top class American masterpieces, there was one I never thought I could ever taste, it's this one - so I cannot thank Bart enough for inviting me to the tasting of this celebrity.  Medium thick, snow white, mousy, opening head with a waferthin, disparate 'veil' of foam left in the middle; equally hazy bright yellow golden robe.  Vibrant, colourful, zesty and slightly dank aroma of drying orange peel, green olives, lime zest, gin, orange water, freshly cut green onions, unripe mango, raw pineapple, dough, peanut oil, yellow grapefruit.  Clean but bright and intense fruitiness hinting at unripe mango, green banana and hard pear, lively carbonated though nowhere harshly so; full, smooth-edged, oily body.  A rounded, clean white-bready maltiness is soaked in aromatic, yet well-contained hoppiness, pineapple-ish and (green-) oniony, but most of all very zesty (lime, pomelo), providing long lingering 'green and yellow' aromas as well as a long-stretched, but refined peppery bitterness, highlighted by a gin-like alcohol warmth - and topped with an ever so subtle sweaty note (frying shallot).  This is about as radiant, refined, wonderfully balanced and at the same time expressive and powerful IPA gets: a truly fantastic beer and a standard in IPA in general indeed, even if the hazy New England idiom has meanwhile taken over the larger part of it.  I feel humbled by this kind of perfection - for me, having initially developed a taste for West Coast boldness, this masterpiece is very much worth the hype, though I also have to add that I would probably not wait for eight hours in line for two bottles, like many people in California apparently did a few weeks ago when this was released.  That said, I have no idea how IPA can be made any more beguiling, beautiful, radiant, balanced and intelligent; I cannot immediately think of a better one I had and at this level of 'mythical status', scores seem rather petty - so heck, have a near perfect score as far as I'm concerned, you deserve it.  Considering how bottles are already sold on the second hand market for hundreds of dollars, the very reason why the brewery never wanted to bottle this beer in the first place, it remains doubtful if this 'experiment' of bottling Pliny the Younger will be repeated next year - so for the time being, I'll consider this a once in a lifetime opportunity, which obviously adds to the experience and, I admit it, to my personal appreciation.",0.0,0.9991

M - Thick, malty and waves of hops.

Russian River Pliny the Younger🇺🇸IIPA DIPA - Imperial / Double IPA,"After such a long quest for some PtY, I was finally able to imbibe on some of this goodness at the Bishop’s Collar in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago. Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesn’t drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise! This beer was perfectly balanced all-around. It is truly such a shame that this beer is ""very expensive and difficult to make under tight space limits"" according to Russian River because this would have been the go-to IPA in many beer circles.

A: Melted gold coloration. Very thin head. Translucent. Clear demarcation of the legs on the glass.

N: I can smell this while holding it at chest level. Intense pineapple notes, mango, passionfruit, and a smattering of grapefruit. Caramel sweetness. Very worthy nose.

T: Massive interplay between sweet and bitter. Grapefruit gives way to some onion that is eventually defeated by earth, pine, conifer, and ash. Bitterness is a 10 on a 10 scale. This is the hoppiest beast on the market. Has the caramel of a good bourbon and some honey melon.

M: Dry and desiccating as a desert. Very sticky and washes around in the mouth. Sublime.

O: A beer like this is worth the effort of the chase if you haven’t had it. Clearly, this is true. Yet, as I drank the 8oz, the desire for another one diminished with each sip. I’ve had it 5 times now, and I don’t see much reason to continue tracking it down year after year.",0.0,0.9456

Live tasting, on tap @ Barley and Hops Olde Worlde Family Tavern... 10oz. Pour into a mini pint glass..

Appearance; pours a gorgeous, crisp clear golden color, head non-existent but that could be due to the line and be fact that they are preparing the beers in advance... The gold color of this beer is perfect, as if Younger knows it’s the #1 beer in the world... 

Smell; grapefruit, orange rinds, citrus in general... Not as heavy on the tropical fruit as Pliny the Elder.. 

Taste; exceptionally smooth, launches right into grapefruit and citrus rinds.. Quite bitter on the finish, moreso than Elder, but certainly not comically so... Good resins and a nice bitter finish. Hides 11% exceptionally well... Smooth and no hints of alcohol or alcohol burn.

Mouthfeel; this is where younger exceeds... Perfect amount of carbonation, but you can definitely sink your teeth into this one... On the lighter side of full bodied... Bitterness plays into the finish beautifully...

Overall; a great beer, and certainly one that I am glad to have experienced, although I don’t know that it was worth $1/ounce and a 45 minute wait... I can easily get Pliny the Elder and I feel like Elder is every bit as solid of a beer, and given the price and accessibility is even more enjoyable although I certainly had a great ...

Poured into a tulip. Deep dark golden, possibly a little orange. Solid two fingers of frothy head. Beautiful lace floated down the glass as I drank.

Big resinous hop aroma; pine and a little bit of the sweet citrus aroma.

Flavor was quite sweet as expected, but I felt it could’ve used a bit more. Honey and caramel were there, but balanced by the sharp astringent bitter finish. I would’ve liked more hop flavor, not just the bitterness.

Perfect carbonation and medium mouth feel -- pretty full-bodied for the style. 

Insanely drinkable for the style. Was easy to put away this bad boy and a struggle to actually try to savor it. An amazing beer, but there are also other great double IPAs out there much easier to get. Glad I had the chance to try it, though.

Overall
The beer came as a complete surprise to me. It's more of an old bourbon-barrel aged Imperial Stout, or even Barleywine and Shaoxingwine, instead of a young Pastry Stout... With almost insanely salty, soy sauce-y and plumy, it reminds me of Goose Island Proprietor's Bourbon County Brand Stout 2014. No trace of common vanilla adjuncts (but it seems that vanilla beans can also have prune-like smell?), neither do marshmallow. Exactly match my palate, however I was expecting something totally different from this bottle. Hard to rate such...

Exactly match my palate, however I was expecting something totally different from this bottle. Hard to rate such... There is no vanilla flavor that is common in other wines (but it is said that the vanilla pod itself has a prune flavor?), and there is no marshmallow. Not to mention that it is really suitable for my taste, but the problem is that I expected something completely different before opening the bottle. It is really a headache to score this wine. . .

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bourbon Vanilla Dark Lord ’15 vintage 

Pours a brown-black color with a dark brown, small head to it, leaving back sheets of thin lacing atop the surface of the beer. Reveals its decadent viscosity after swirling, by revealing alcohol legs and tiny, dark brown bubbles at the glass.

Intense aromas of fudge, bakers chocolate and burned malts, tied together by a ridiculously rich Bourbon appearance, featuring flowery vanilla, a whiff of cinnamon, apple piths and a ton of scentened oak. Vanilla is easily detectable, while well entangled into the Bourbon, adding a organic, sweet, flowery freshness to the chocolate decadence. Mousse au chocolate, moldy earth, toffee and brownie batter round out this monster on the nose, so far truly a masterpiece, which I actually find hard to compare to the regular Dark Lord.

Has a supersmooth mouthfeel, due to its very low carbonation, next to a silk, omnipresent creaminess, coating the tongue and soothing the pleasantly integrated Bourbon effectivly.

Tastes of a spice soaked, earth coated oakiness, featuring the beers velvet mouthfeel from the start. Develops an enjoyable warmth, as the Bourbon unfolds its spice profile, together with vanilla, licorice, molasses and fudge. Vanilla certainly deserves an additional mentioning as it not only stands out from the Bourbon, but directly blends into the beers smooth cream quality, producing a heavenly, well accentuated sweetness, from which the profound spices benefit big times during the finish. Ends with cinnamon, red apple, fudge, molasses and a long lasting, silk, vanilla coke quality, smoothing out the Bourbon oak entirely.

Wow, what a behemoth of a beer. I guess it would be almost impossible to drink more of a few couple of oz of this, if it wasn’t for the soothing combination of cream and vanilla. This doesn’t turn overly roasty, but fudgy smooth with a ton of sweet chocolate to it, amped up by the spicy Bourbon. The different flavors come beautifully together, while this is still being best enjoyed in small sips, as for its profound sweetness.",0.03656362120635653,0.9966

Taste: OMG, is this BCBS Coffee? Could’ve fooled me. Honestly, very similar: here we have sweet chocolate, bitter coffee, and, every now and then, puffs of sweet marshmallow. A little sweeter than BCBS Coffee. Ends with a smooth vanilla flavor.

Split with my friend Keith who attended DLD with me this year. Served in a FFF mini-snifter. Reviewed from notes. 

A- Upon pouring, a mocha head quickly appears and dies down within 30 seconds, leaving a ring of foam around the rim of the glass. The color is opaque black, thick like motor oil. 

S- The first thing I can smell is a very strong bourbon barrel presence, but it is quickly joined by vanilla, coffee, and a sweet molasses like aroma. Excellent aroma, it definitely invites you to take a drink.

T- I don’t think it would be possible to use any more descriptors for this beer. Black cherries, prunes, vanilla, followed by some tobacco and caramel with bourbon strong on the finish. There is a lingering sweetness that is very familiar from regular dark lord on the back end, and surprisingly little to no alcohol bite, even with the bourbon flavor being so apparent. There is no detectable hop bitterness. 

M- Silky smooth, yet very thick at the same time. This is definitely a sipper, but it is very easy to drink. Low-medium carbonation is right on for the style. The flavors linger and change over the incredibly long finish, definitely over a minute later I can still taste the beer. 

O- This is a very enjoyable, incredibly complex beer. I’m glad I hadn’t drank anything before this, because it was such a pleasure to really get into this beer and enjoy the full range of flavors you can get from it. The bourbon is there on the nose and finish, but the vanilla really outshines it, at least in my opinion. I’m sure that will die down with time, although I think this is simply amazing as it is right now. It was an honor to drink this beer, so very glad I was able to score one this year!",0.0,0.9969

Fitting since this beer marks my discovery of something that is at the same level as Goose Island’s BCS Rare. Yes, what I thought was my one and only 5.0 rating now has a companion. How can I say this is as good as Rare? Well after drinking, my wife and I say to Joe that it is one of the best beers we have ever had, but not sure it is better than Rare. What does Joe go and do, yes he pulls a Rare out of his cellar and we do a blind impromptu tasting!!! I admit on this day the Vanilla DL was better than the Rare (I was able to choose each correctly), but the Rare did not taste quite as good as when I had it initially. I can’t thank Joe enough for his generosity on this night. I guess I will put some actual beer comments in now. Of course this was a black pour with tan head.

Three Floyds Dark Lord - Bourbon Vanilla Bean🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"750 ml waxed bottle, 552/934, served in a Deschutes snifter. Big thanks to Andrew (nasty31) for the share.

A: Pours a jet black color with a nice sized dark mocha head forming on the pour. It recedes a medium sized ring and leaves some splotchy lace along the way.

S: Light bourbon up front, but the sweet vanilla pushes right through that. A great toasted malt presence follows that with some light milk chocolate on the finish.

T: Instead of bourbon up front the vanilla is the star here (obviously). There is a mild background bourbon that is incredibly smooth. As Dark Lord is already a pretty sweet beer (especially the 2011) I felt the added vanilla bean made this border on cloyingly sweet. Thankfully there was enough roast and dark chocolate on the finish to cut through some of the sweetness.

M: Heavy bodied with a light chew to it. Teeth coating sweetness with a medium to low carbonation. Definite warming as it goes down.

O: I think if the vanilla bean was slightly restrained it would have been an even bigger homerun. That being said, this was absolutely delicious and I would not hesitate to try this again. The 4-5 ounce pour I received was just perfect.

 I hate it when I give in to the hype of these over priced Three Floyds beers.  I resent the fact that I had to pay $50 for a beer that I ""won"" in a lottery.  However, splitting with two other great friends, and the fact the beer is absolutely amazing, pretty much eases the pain.  

 I was going to describe all of the nuances of this beer, but I’ve decided that I’m too lazy right now.  I will just say that, this is my favorite bourbon barrel aged beer that I know to exist.  It also seems to the most appropriate use of a vanilla bean that is known to mankind.  Two years in a row, well played Three Floyds.",0.0,0.9265

Overall
Bourbon and soy sauce dominated, it wasn't as thick as I expected on mouth. Beat BBT 2017 with a certain reluctance yet still inferior to KBBS. To be honest, I wasn't sure I could separate out this versus BCBS 2015 on blind. Still one of best non-adjunct Imperial Stout though.

This wine is dominated by bourbon barrels and soy sauce flavors, and it is not as thick as I expected. It barely surpasses BBT2017, but still not as good as KBBS. To be honest, I am not 100% sure to taste it out when it is put together with BCBS2015 in a blind tasting. Despite this, it is still one of the best non-adjunct Imperial Stouts.

Inescapably funkalicious aroma. Deep, funky, untamed. Off the charts awesome aroma. 



Dry hay, gueuze-y funk; sourness is there but not too bold. If you don't know what people mean by horse blanket in gueuze, you certainly will after this. Layers of depth and intrigue; gueuze really doesn't get much better than this.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"2003 J and J version (not 50/50) drunk Summer of 2009 at my Farewell to the beer scene tasting
Inserted this one in the middle of the lineup, thankfully, so the palate was not fatigued. At almost six years old, it still poured a wonderfully frothy, white head, showing moderate retention and plentiful carbonation. Soft, straw/white-gold body, plenty of sediment on the bottom.
The nose creeps up on you, this is certainly not getting you by means of raw force/strength. The best part, and i will admit to being slightly hazy on all of the details, being that this was four years ago, was a soft, but yet tart hickory skin/limeade-like note that seemed to hover in the background and keep gaining strength as the beer warmed/breathed. Very dry and with tons of lactic acid but yet all well-presented. Some barnyard notes emerging late but just the most succulent, soft, yet strong brett notes I’ve witnessed.
In the mouth, the carbonation is fairly reserved for the style, with a warm woodiness that plays well with the tart, limey brett notes. Not overly sour, though significantly moreso than the Milennium gueuze I had a few months ago. Very ""true"" flavors of gueuze, lactic, brett fruity tartness, light band-aids; all that I associate with Girardin, though not as intensely sour as that usually seems. Interesting mineral-like note to it as well.  Finish leaves lactic acids lingering, with a bit of cheesiness and more unripened citrus fruits. Carbonation is soft by now, and the body is medium, with a supple texture from the malts and wheat. Wonder if I’ll ever try this again! Thanks to whomever traded me these (can’t remember at this point).
Bottle drunk 6/10/16, shared by Joe Z. Thanks!
Wow was this in just immaculate shape.  Even handily beat the Roze we opened just before it.  Limestone, white grape, soft oak, hickory nut skin, light band aids, very light sulfur....most of the stuff I look for in the top lambics.  Carbonation still VERY strong.  Texture is perfect.  Really can’t ask for much more from a gueuze.  Previously had it at 4.6.",0.0,0.9958
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Acquired in a trade from Mads in Denmark in February of 2013. Allowed this beer to sit horizontal in my basement for 10 months and now I’m ready to open it up on a random Saturday night by myself before a trip. Nothing fancy, just because. Also, temp of this thing is 55 at serving in a Cantillon Tulip. I allowed the glass I poured to sit for 15 minutes to sort of liven up a bit and just sort of chill the fuck out. It was bottled like 10 years ago...best let this beast chill! The cork was perfectly intact but had escaped out of the bottle by a couple of centimeters. The cage held up great.



A - Appearance is on par with Oude Gueuze Vintage 2002-2005 era. Mahogany oak and minor orange notes. A more reddish brown than gueuze being released today. Is that just age? Probably not because the 20 year old gueuze I’ve had from others wasn’t this dark. The cork whisper heavily but did not explode or gush thankfully.



S - There are a few levels to this nose. You can do a one ounce pour, swish heavily and you get this blossom or oranges, lemon skin, wet hay and musty fecal aromas. Then if you let the beer chill out for a bit, it’s this cheesy old shoe with what I’d consider to be the cheesiest basement aroma like the moldiest old stone basement. Something to consider at this age though is storage conditions.If it was kept in an old damp basement, that will certainly influence the nose.



T - This is probably the most orange and lemon forward gueuze I’ve ever had. It’s also the most moldy wet blanket gueuze I’ve ever had. I’m reviewing this beer over a few glasses so I can get the full effect. It’s not really sour, more tart like a lemon, fruity like clementines and moldy, funky just leathery wet hay. It is the most ""rotten"" tasting gueuze I’ve ever had and, to that effect, I freaking love it!



M - The carbonation is as I expected. Not a huge explosion just a nice cork wisp with a 1 finger head that faded slowly. The beer still explodes nicely on a heavy swish with a Harbaugh approved 15% carbonation (do I really have to explain to him what that means? He’s a freaking science teacher right?) Lingering rotten grapefruit rind sticks around.



O - For what Blauw is trading for now, it’s slowly moving past its prime. The first review was in May of 2005. So that well debated 10 year fall off that Drie Fonteinen gueuze has is starting to hit. I want to say the mold / damp hay I get is totally because of storage conditions which is understandable. Is this worth a case of Framboos? No way. It’s still really freaking delicious and hopefully people rating it now get to have more than an ounce of it. It’s best shared 2-3 ways like most 75CL Gueuze. Amazing this is a whale now but age & bottles in circulation will do that. Personally, Golden Blend, Armand & Tomme, Lente, Zomer and 2007 Oude Gueuze Vintage score higher than this in my book but for different reasons. They’re all younger than this beer and brighter. I prefer them to this but this gueuze was still an experience worth going through.",0.0,0.9966
3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Enjoyed July 13, 2013. Poured from a basket into a Drie Fonteinen stem. Cork shot out with a pop, and gushed about 2 ounces. Have glasses ready! Pours a mildly hazy, golden orange with three plus fingers of sticky, frothy white head. Lots of retention, and lacing. Smell is stunning. Overly ripe peaches and apricots, lemon rind, and a deep earthy funk. Incredibly well balanced and integrated. As it warms, the funk evolves, opening up with barnyard and minerally earth. The stone fruits become more prominent and tropical. I could smell this forever. Taste is bright peach flesh, funk, and tropical sour fruits. Some lemon rind. Lightly sweet. The funk becomes more pronounced as it warms, yet never overpowers the beautiful fruit aspect. Truly incredible how vibrant this is after 10 years. Despite being a massive gusher, this was perfectly carbonated. The balance of flavors lends this to be incredibly drinkable and refreshing. Simply, this beer was nearly flawless, and probably the best beer I’ve ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Vibrant in every way, yet utterly balanced.",0.0,0.9932

Taste is rich and probably as complex as it gets, every sip is a different note, stunning. Strong funkyness again and tartness sorrounded by a sort of yogurt-like sweetness.

Unclear orange with a medium diminishing white head that leave’s a small forever lasting white head and superb lacing. Beautiful beer!  Aroma is lemony with herbal/floral notes and mild Gueuze aroma characteristics. Taste is incredibly smooth and wonderfully complex. Fruits (lemon, grapefruit, apple, pineapple), wood, barnyard and leather. Dry and citric mouthfeel. Well carbonated.

Updated: Bottle (750 ml). Tasted again at De Heeren van Liedekercke on April 20th 2014 just before Roze and Heerengueuze. My rating stay the same as the one up here.

A: Much darker amber color than the Roze. A nice frothy white head forms on the pour and slowly recedes to a thick collar and thin cap. Splotchy lace is left behind.

S: Sour raspberry, tart cherries and some oak. Light sweetness and mild funk as well. blends really nicely together.

T: Dark sour cherry with a nice pucker. Almost like a warhead candy with out the artificial sugar flavors. Tart raspberry, vanilla sweetness, some woody oak and nice funky cheese on the finish.

M: Light bodied with a crisp, drying mouthfeel. The sourness gets in there gives you a nice pucker. A real jowl hitter.

O: I enjoyed this just a tad more than the Roze as it had more a sour kick to it. The Roze was more vibrant, but this beer went deeper in flavor. Huge thanks again to Sean (Sean9689) for sharing this rarity!!

Tasted along with the J&J Roos.

A: Gorgeous. Hazy orange. Pretty lacing.

Opened the bottle following a trade earlier this week and after having noticed that the cork was a bit dried out (making some gas escape)... Despita that - beer was still in a perfect condition drank it paired with a first course based on tuna and a Danish smeus as the main course)... Now the beer: pours hazy golden orange with constant and continuous creamy white head (looks like beaten egg whites). Aroma of wood (and plenty of it), some green herbs (cresson, parcely) and spices (I had some cloves and thyme). Medium body with fresh yet very subtle acidity which pushes its way through from the middle to finish extremely dry. Taste is again some wood, citrussy notes. Wauuw, truly an incredible beer - and one of my favourite geuzes!

A - Pours murky reddish orange with a huge two finger tall bright white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving thin wisps of lace down the glass.




S - Smells of funky basement must, barn yard hay, lemon peel, sour apples, drying oak tannins, and a bright acidic tartness. It kind of smells like ripe cheese with a bit of tartness thrown in. Very nice.




T - Starts off with a big, sharp, acidic kick quickly giving way to a mix of musty funk, wet hay, lemon zest, granny smith apples, and drying oak tannins. The sourness is strong initially but it quickly gets enveloped by the strong barnyard funk. The finish is bone dry, lingering for some time.




M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Tart, funky, feel with lots of dryness in the finish. It has an good balance of funk to tart throughout.




O - While I personally preferred the sharp tartness of the Roos to the funky must of the Blauw, this is still an excellent beer. They truly are the perfect complement to each other. Hope I get to try this one again in the future. Thanks again Kramer!",0.0,0.9918

Pours with a nice golden hue and a single-finger white head with some good retention as well as a good dose of lacing and a nice collar after that settles down. Light carbonation bubbles atop the beer throughout. How long they would have stayed, I’m not all that sure--try as I might to drink this slowly, I couldn’t really help myself. The nose was quite funky with a bit of sourness. A nice oak presence and a lot of horse blanket. This was just extremely pungent.

The taste had some really nice lactic character as well as musty basement notes and some lemon. Good barnyard-y hay character and a slight woodiness. The mouthfeel was quite dry with just enough carbonation. Excellent funk presence throughout with a good amount of sourness to balance. Amazingly complex, this was a bottle I could have consumed all of, and am glad we opened this outside without losing any, especially given the fact that I believe the cork shot out a good 25 feet or more.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Served at a tasting, side by side, with the J&J Roos. First thing is first. The labels of these beers are great. Oil paintings of a silhouette of a nude female torso profile, its just such a pretty painting. I understand that these beers were originally brewed for the brewer’s wedding and the roos was for the wife (naked woman on the label) and the Blau was for the husband (naked man on the label). Great concept.

Beer is yellow and hazy, just like the other one. Head is small bubbles, white to off white.

Aroma is a strong funk and completely sour. More funky than the Roos but still amazing smelling.

There is a lot of citric based sour in this beer. This reminds me a lot of a Cantillon Helena but totally different. Beer is tart and there is a slight sulfur taste really late. Overall this beer is very similar to the Roos, slightly less sour, slightly more funk, and there’s some sulfur in the palate. I understand that most people like the Blau over the Roos but I’m the opposite. Both are great but the Roos is slightly better.

Sadly the beer itself didn’t redeem my experience, maybe too high of expectations on my part but based upon the seasoned palate of Alex and Sean who shared that their previous bottle was much better, it might be high time to drink these bad boys up. Especially considering this beer was about a month old straight ouf of De Heeren where you presume they are being stored at proper conditions and not waste deep in a flooded basement or off site completely. But I digress(if you want the full store just bm me)....As everyone mentioned, be prepared when opening, highly carbonated. Golden pour with a decent amount of head, not as much as you would expect though, a good thing. Good retention and lacing...A decent nose of funkyiness but it its weirdly acidic and stale to me. Lots of oak was surprising, sterile in a weird way for me...Taste was slightly better but still a sterile presence to it, inhibited in some way. Oak, lactic, sour horse blanket. The right players are there, just not working completely.

S: Seems to be a bit more composed than the Roos. Lots of wet oak, hay, lemon, green apple, and grass. There’s a nice acidity to the nose along with plenty of ""green"" funk.

T: The lemon, green apple, and lactic acidity is more pronounced on the palate than the nose lets on. Plenty of must, oak, along with hay and grass. A definite funkiness that I would put under the ""barnyard"" umbrella.

M: The body is medium with a high level of carbonation and a bone dry finish.

The aroma is really nice and funky showing notes of sour citrus fruit and acidity from the likes of orange, grapefruit, and lemons. The musty, horse blanket barnyard yeast lends a funky, spicy, earthy quality as well. The oak barrel imparts some vanilla that smooths out the citric acidity. The flavor follows with the intense sour citrus acidity with the lemons, grapefruits, and some soft peach pushing their way through. Some white grapes and tannins from the oak come next and seem to balance out the intense sourness. The funky, barnyard yeast really shines though and lends some earthiness to it all.

T-the funky earthy musk is right up front, notes of aged cheese and chardonnay, tart white grapes, soft peaches, with a touch of sweetness.  acidity comes in at the finish with the lemon from the nose.

M-great feel, a little grainy, huge carbonation with a crisp finish and solid body throughout.

How: Bottle at DHVL.  Consumed when about 6 year of age 

The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a large off-white head

In long: Nose is very funky, even by Geuzes standards.  The aroma is very barnyard, old carpet, funk dust, etc.  Taste is very intense.  High Acidity, high sourness, lots of funk, horse blanket, fruit skin, some sawdust.  A lot less wood but a lot more “wild stuff” than in its Roze sister.  I had the beer twice in tastings but wanted to have a full bottle by myself before I rate it.  I was hoping for the greatest gueuze ever, not quite, but this is one worth the hype nonetheless.

Cork blasted off but there was only the smallest amount lost before pouring a rich gold body with large, unshakable fluffy white head. “Funk” is a vague word, but it best describes perhaps the most complex nose I’ve sniffed in a geuze, the first 6-7 swirls each giving a new element: mushroom, earth, leaves and grass, lemon, lime, leather. The flavor keeps this up, trading element after element in a funky earth way that never compromises yet never breaks from the balance. Like Mingus leading a 10-piece band, this is at once chaotic and sublime while simultaneously tight as all hell and brooding like sin. The massive funk rules out any easy fruit acidity or pale malt as havens to run for when expecting a traditional lambic. By my experience, this is geuze at its most hardcore and earthy.

This beer is from 2003!!! The best word to describe this beer is BRIGHT. The colors of it in the glass are almost neon and flavors explode out of the vessel. You can smell of its nuances from a few feet away. What!? There is no horse blanket, sweat, or funkiness to me. Instead there is ultra fresh grapefruit rind, curacao, blood orange, and white pepper in the nose. Super fresh, citrusy, and tart. Taste is similar. Super sour but not astringent or overpowering. It is a very refined sour that complements the citrus flavors and almost lemon/lime thirst quenching character. It is so spectacular that you really don’t want to sit down and write down what you thought about it. You just want to savor it and thank Jesus that such a fantastic creation exists on this planet.

Congratulations even though it is some time ago now. The blend og the lambic is so good. It’s balanced and mild but at the same time agressive and bitter. Without a doubt one of the best gueuzes I ever had. It appears light shady yellow with an impressive with crown on top. The aroma is classic grapefruit-like - very nice. The taste is also classic with a capital C and balanced as hell. Its sparkling with a light buttery palate. Thank you for this one.,0.0,0.9843

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Another huge thanks to Alex (MasterSki) for acquiring this bottle for our sour/wild tasting. Poured from 750ml bottle into Bell’s Tulip.

Holy shit, Alex just tried to kill Dave while opening this one! This one is a gusher! Luckily, Dave didn’t die but the only problem is he went after the cat who was sprayed with the Blauw nectar. The cat made it out alive, but I can’t look at Dave the same ever again.

A - Pours mirky burnt orange with a HUGE white fizzy head. I had to let this one settle down a bit before pouring some more into my glass. The head on this one is crazy-big! Lots of sticky white lacing is left behind by the enormous head.

S - Holy super-funk! I thought I knew about funk until I poured this beer and took a whiff. I now have a new appreciation for all that is funk from Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen! Lost of stinky cheese notes but really all I can say is FUNK!

T - Uh...funk? Yeah, that’s it! Very acidic as well along with some lemon citrus notes. Not quite as mind-blowing as the smell, but excellent, nonetheless. 

M - Light boded. SUPER DRY...in fact, the liquid absorbs the saliva in your mouth and then tries to turn your face inside out. Okay, maybe not that bad, but it has a very dry finish. Nice fizzy carbonation which is champagne-esk and works well with this beer.

D - Not as drinkable as the previous two wilds I just had simply because my palate would be stripped of all taste buds after finishing this bottle. However, it’s an oustanding beer.",0.0,0.9873

The flavor has lots of bitter grapefruit peel, various citric fruit rinds, funk, and lots of other citric juciness. Full mouthfeel and surprisingly smooth and creamy.

Tons of gravel. An incredible minerality to the nose. Rotten orange peel. As it warms, the orange peel turns to a grapefruit note. Loads of dirty, funky, wet-animal like sharpness. Old cedar. Wow. Pours a glowing, hazed dark orange with a pillowy, fluffy, lasting eggshell white head. Flavor is insanely sharp, funky and dry. Absolutely zero residual sweetness. Stones, gravel... Leather. Sharp, sharp acid. Long aged cheese and earthy mushrooms. A slight hint of tangy smoke. Moist cedar wood. Wet wood tannin all over the sides and especially the back of the tongue.

3 Fonteinen J & J Oude Geuze Blauw🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Massive thanks to Jan for sharing this rarity and what better bottle to celebrate Fathers Day and review #900.

The cork pops with some serious power and we have a gusher!  Not much lost, but I’m glad I had a glass ready to go as the foam started pouring out.  It’s a hazy orange with an initial head that’s taller than the beer in the glass itself.  The head recedes slowly, leaves very good lacing and stays on as a bubbly collar for the duration.

The aroma is massive and jumps out of the bottle.  It’s all about the funk in the nose - a combination of mustiness and barnyard aromas that dominates the nose.  There are lighter sour apple and tart lemon notes but the funk is the major player in the nose.

The taste is nothing short of sublime.  It extremely complex but very well-balanced.  It starts with a tart lemony zing but also has more sweet fruits than the aroma, with apples and pears.  On top of that is a yeast presence that I didn’t get in the aroma which lends a slight spiciness to the proceedings.  The funk comes back and leaves a big dry and musty finish.

Mouthfeel is very dry and wine-like with tons of carbonation and lots of tartness and funk that leaves the palate tingling throughout.

Well, I’ve been late to the sour craze and I have struggled sometimes to get the complexity and overall quality of some of the funky beers I’ve tasted.  I didn’t have that problem here.  This is probably the best sour I’ve ever had and.  It’s got everything you’d want in a good sour - tartness, funk, fruit and in all the right doses.  Outstanding.",0.0,0.9897

I was hoping to find a bottle of this on a recent trip to De Heeren but was suprised to find it available there for sample at a beer fest they were having behind the restaurant. Wow! For the price of about $3 a got a nice sample of about 6 oz or so.

Clean, mineral bitterness; earthy notes of hay and grass.  Flavor is brisk and tangy; a sunny, ebullient sourness that consistently seems soft and reticent, putting aside the confronting acidic funk for something more calm and more sensitive.  The acetic punch thoroughly muted by citrus acids and crabapple tartness, and a hint of wildflower honey.       



 Yeast addition yields a thorough coating of basement must through the aroma and the flavor.  Lots of pithy citric bitterness and tangy acids lingering.  Crisp, punchy, full mouthfeel; dries out with some sweet lemony funk and cheeses in the long finish.  




I love the forward tropical fruits here and the perfect blanket of musty funk, never so light as to be insufficient or so heavy as to be burdensome.  The careful touch of this brewery evident in most of its offerings seems exemplified here, and it’s easily the finest quality of this angelic, legendary example.  Thanks Ken!",0.0,0.9722

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Poured from a 2012 vintage, 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is a bit oxidized with some light wet cardboard and more raisin, fig, prune and date than when fresher. Medium light roast notes with light chocolate and lighter caramel and toffee. Faint bourbon and oak notes. Not much coffee at all. 
Pours black with a medium sized, thick, dark mocha head that recedes steadily to a small film that lingers on the edges. Faint lacing and fairly long legs.

Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this much age isn't good for this beer. I have had it plenty of times fresh or with a couple years and it's much better than this old bottle. But as I was drinking this bottle I went to check my rating and realized I never rated this before. I'd say it's best to drink within 2 or 3 years of bottling.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"May 10th, 2016 -  Rounding up the trio of Alesmith Stouts and their different flavor variants is the Barrel Aged version of the OG, with a high price, an ABV and my high expectations. The smell is potent, even from a 4 oz. taster glass, and shows off the barrel aging and oak nicely. The flavor is also exceptionally smooth, strong and potent, with a solid hit of alcohol, and a good bourbon taste. Solid, meaty and strong, it's a triple threat, and definitely worth of following the other Speedway styles.

September 3rd, 2015 - The Alesmith Vietnamese Coffee stout is a premier beer, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged version is no slouch. With a smooth, opalescent look it offers classic and classy alcohol and oak notes, smoldering with ethanol. The taste is much gentler, both sweet and delicate, but also bold and robust. A licorice sweetness mixes with the taste of Japanese whisky, and a thinner palate let's everything shine through.",0.0,0.9814

Aroma is green apples, phenolic, ethanol, oak sugar, chocolate. Taste is again green apples and phenols, oak sugar, light tartness. Higher carbonation than the other Speedways today. Not as good as expected, it?s a bit too phenolic. A slight disappointment for Alesmith standards. Maybe this year was not as great as previous ones? Or maybe I?m becoming a BA grump now as well.

APPEARANCE: Completely black in color, just a few brown sparkles on top; brown foam crown with little retention, compact and open bubbles, some alcohol legs in the glass.

AROMA: Sweet and liquor-like, the character of the barrel predominates with notes of sweet bourbon, wood and vanilla, as well as semi-sweet chocolate, fudgie like brownie, caramel, the alcohol is perceived intensely.

FLAVOR: Again sweet and liquor-like followed by an explosion of flavors, from the beginning the characteristics of the barrel are well present, notes of bourbon, vanilla and charred wood, followed by intense predominance of vanilla and caramel flavor, behind this notes of semi-sweet chocolate, fudgie like brownie, caramel and sometimes you can perceive some toasted coffee but very lightly. The aftertaste is a light/medium-low bitterness, with a long persistence of notes of sweet bourbon, vanilla, wood and caramel.

Sensation: Full body, silky mouthfeel, low carbonation. The alcohol is noticeable in the mouth but is not aggressive, a warm sensation remains in the throat when the liquid is swallowed.

Misc.: AleSmith Tap Takeover night

First time reviewing this, but third time tasting it. Picked this over Vietnamese Coffee variant, assuming I would get to have that next (this did not happen). Loved it the last two times I tasted it and expecting at least a 4.50.

Poured a black color with one finger of khaki tan head when I got it. Minima lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled toffee, smooth milk chocolate, buttery bourbon syrup, caramel, roasty malts and wet cocoa powder. (Smell - 4.50)

Tasted much boozier than the smell. Super hot from the get-go. Bourbon heavy, chocolate, toffee, caramel and smooth dark milk chocolate. Bourbon was just overwhelming. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Not quite as good as the last few times I had this at AleSmith. Not sure what it was, but picked a bad time to review this. Will have it again for sure though. (Overall - 4.25)

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Speedway BA ’14 vintage, many thanks to Marcel.

Poura a completely black color, with nearly no head at all.

Has the most distinctive Bourbon barrel presence, I have yet experienced. Despite the Bourbon dominance, coffee cuts through easily among a huge amount of wood, as well as scorched, earthy malts. Hints of molasses remind me of this being a stout, setting the balance, but nothing more, this beer is focused on its warming coffee Bourbon blend. 

Drinks throughout smooth, perfectly fitting for the full body of the beer to unfold.

Not only becomes the Bourbon recognizable on the palate very early, the oaky barrel quality seemingly stands out on itself, blending perfectly into earthy, pleasantly bitter coffee beans. As on the nose, there is a certain, almost sticky sweetness detectable in the beer, but only as a neccesary counterpart to the fiery Bourbon coffee melange, adding toffee, cocoa nibs and fudge to the blend. Liquor heat gets perfectly wrapped up by the coffee, with a sweeter, slick finish, turning into a chocolate direction at the very end, accompanied by vanilla, booze and earthy ground coffee - revealing throughout a fantastic flavour variety.

Impressive beer, huge, bold, focused, while leaving enough space on the palate to exhibit an intriguing depth. Pretty much focused on coffee and Bourbon, with a mousse au chocolate creamy nouthfeel to it, providing oak, heat, fudge and gourmet coffee.",0.0,0.9958

The pour is a viscous oily black with a dark khaki colored head and a few clingy spots of excellent lace. The aroma is really something else. The bourbon and the vanilla really dominate up front. But the complexity that falls in with the chocolate and the toasted malt and coffee are just incredible. There is a mild pakiness going on with a touch of smoke on the back end. Just everything is hope for. The flavor is really good. There is a beautiful bourbon heat up front and it rolls through a plethora of pleasing flavors. Vanilla and chocolate, roasted coffee and smoked oak. The levels of complexity are great. The mouth feel is a touch thin. I like the soft carbonation and the syrupy clinginess of the beer, but I think the bourbon takes a little away from the thickness of the mouth feel. The aftertaste is incredible.

The brown head is sublime and it sticks in small diamond points on the wall of my glass. When I turn it towards the light, I realize the viscosity of this rare potion and I like it enormously. So I hasten to plunge my big nose into it and the shock is brutal. It is simply sublime. It is profoundly rich.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Three year old bottle, but with black neckfoil (the print on the bottle says ""with coffee and aged in bourbon barrels"", so I assume it is the same thing). One of the most expensive beers I ever bought, delivered to me by my dear former colleague Maaike. I taste this a little above cellar temperature from an old port wine snifter. Black colour (but in fact an extremely dark ochre brown), thin deep beige head, a little more ’loose’ than I had expected and breaking open after a short while but retaining well around the edges, with a delicate, silky lacing. The aroma is heavenly: a dense, thick, strong and intoxicating perfume of all the good things you would expect in a big stout, and more. Impressions of freshly roasted coffee beans, kahlua, orange liqueur, warm chocolate sauce, cognac, liquorice, vanilla beans, peat, leather, oaky tannins and even moist wood, gingerbread, hints of soy sauce, cooked meat, cloves and butterscotch. This liquid commands respect, nothing in the nose reveals even the faintest flaw; I’m beginning to understand why this beer scores so high on this site. Taste is... well, intense, to say the least: an overpowering symphony of candied fruits, espresso beans, fondant chocolate, vanilla, oak, candi syrup, dried orange peel... Difficult to point out which comes first. Carbonation is sharpish, even a bit fizzy at first; mouthfeel is thick and smooth, somewhat cloyingly sweet at first but drying more and more towards the end, over a big yet refined, oily, multi-layered maltiness. Spiciness, bitterness and intensity increase in the finish, where a strong bourbon presence takes the lead along with strong woody tannins, with a drying, even somewhat burning effect which can be felt from the tip of the tongue till deep in the throat; peppery hops are quite strong as well, and so is the remaining syrupy maltiness. The bourbon alcohol and the strong, coffeeish roasted bitterness keep struggling for dominance but remain matched. How sweet the onset may have been, the ending of this complex ale is bone dry.  This is a powerful, demanding form of liquid gastronomy in which many things are happening at the same time. Still: this is, contrary to what I had expected, probably not quite the best stout I tasted so far - the alcohol burn is just a little bit too much over the top for me, the mouth and throat keep sticking a bit with the initial candied sugariness and it is, for this particular style, a bit overcarbonated. Nevertheless: hugely complex, hugely enjoyable, very impressive with a formidable balance between sweet and bitter, both present in their most ’compressed’ and intense form. Something to be reckoned with and enjoyed carefully, concentratedly - and sip by sip. Wow, what an experience... Big cheers to Maaike!",0.0,0.9978

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Bottle shared by Brad, (thank you!) on 10/8/16.
High clarity leaving behind the sediment and revealing a sunset-hued golden body with a surprisingly large, white head showing strong retention for the style.
The nose is quite grape-forward, showing what definitely smells very Concord-esque. Many say Welch’s grape jelly, and while I don’t think it’s that uncouth, there’s no denying the similarities. There’s definitely some light powdered sugar evident but the sourness/acidity is quite nicely controlled and it smells soft, mild, even, etc....No alcohol or flaws and not exactly a study in funk, but certainly some mineral, very light horseblanket and light grapeseed suggestions.
Flavor is surprisingly acidic with lots of grapeseed and grapeskin character. These types of grapes are very tannic and it shows here. It’s pretty nicely integrated with the lambic, though it’s still quite prominent. Tart acidity and a very tight, engaging carbonation keep it zesty, bright and refreshing, with soft, malt and wheat backing it. Dry, of course with interesting flavors arising from the combination of grape and lambic, as per usual. Still, I wouldn’t call this terribly funky, certainly not by Cantillon standards. Is that why it’s liked by so many?? That’s definitely not why I like Cantillon....",0.0,0.9911

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Bottle shared at Mikey’s - 2011 - Murky off-purple pour into cantillon tulip, this is perfection in a glass.

Lamvinus with some cobweb and equestrian essence to mellow things out. Big thank you to Franco for the expedited shipping and the opportunity to try this. Thanks also to the kind FedEx customs rep who said she would ""see what she could do"" after it was flagged. Can’t wait to see how this develops over the next decade.

After sharing and tasting many more bottles of this, at Dirty Truth Thanksgiving dinner 2011, at the lambic tasting in Monroe, the Stockholm lambic tasting 2013 ,and more recently at the Denver Ghost Tasting, this pour continues to illustrate why grape lambic embodies all that I desire in a beer. It really doesn’t get any better than this, having had nearly all the grape lambics and variants from Cantillon.

Taste is acidic and sweet with grapes and candies upfront. Midway through the sip you get some mineral qualities, almost salty, then cheese and dust and quite a lot of funk. Dry sour finish. Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, a big personal whale and a very good lambic too. It’s probably no better than a SanLam in absolute terms, but the DQ is truly unique.",0.07808688094430302,0.8764
Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Bottle decanted and poured into a Cantillon tulip. Pour is a mildly hazy, juicy magenta. A finger of pink head. Smell is beautiful, rich grape and lemon acidity. A good dose of funk as well. Jammy grapes and lemon acidity on the taste. Grape flavor is rich, but not too sweet... balanced well with one of the cleanest funk profiles I’ve ever encountered. Minerally and delicious. Mouthfeel is rich, juicy, yet untterly drinkable. Dry finish. Overall... this might be tied with Blauw for the best beer I’ve ever had. Certainly the best fruited lambic. Perhaps we will meet again one day!",0.24019223070763068,0.99

As soon as you dig your nose into the glass your hit with the most beautiful, candy grape smelling flavor ever. On top of the grape dankness, there is a good bit of horseblanket, fruit skin, and barn. Flavor is concord grapes, acidic peach, vintage oak, blanket, and sour cherries. Dances on the tongue with a perfectly balanced body. This is honestly the best smelling and tasting lambic I have encountered.

Pours a reddish/orange color, fizzy white head. Some lacing along the sides of the glass and a thin film on top as the cap. Grape juice, oak, funk/tart. I’m a huge fan of the Concord grape juice-esk smell. The funk melds wonderfully with the grapes and the oak notes are an added bonus. Solid. Grapes, tart/sour notes, slight oak, fruit characteristics, some must old barn in there as well. I am in lust with this beer. Light, champagne-esk lively carbonation, dry finish.

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"HUGE thanks to Umberto for busting out this rare treat during our epic drinking session at The Goblin Pub in Pavullo nel Frignano, Italy. Your generosity knows no limits! 

Pours a hazy, bright amber color with golden orange edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind. 

Sweet vinous aroma with a really strong grape presence countered by a decent amount of musty funk. Nice earthy barnyard character with some horseblanket, lactic funk, cobweb, oak and grape must. Subtle acetic presence but the sweet grape and vinous dark fruit notes keep it in check. Very inviting nose with the vinous fruit and musty funk complimenting each other perfectly. 

Tart and puckering with a good amount of sourness but it never becomes harsh or overly acidic. Lots of earthy barnyard funk and sweet, vinous fruit notes balance things out. Kind of reminds me of fresh St. Lamvinous but just a bit sweeter and more vinous. There’s a very prominent grape presence that counters the dry, musty funk and sour acidity nearly perfectly. Surprising how prominent the vinous fruit still is after four years. Some brett and lactic funk contribute to the complexity yet this beer remains delicate and easy to drink with some lingering acetic flavor in the finish that leaves me drooling for more. I could see this being too sweet and not sour enough for some people but I loved the balance of flavors.",0.0,0.9973

The Don pours cruddy reddish amber with a small white head that settles to a ring and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.    The musty, earthy grape juice.  Lots of grape juice, like Welch’s.  There is also an aroma that smells like smarties as well as a bit of a mineral note and very light sulfur.  The initial taste has a bit of sweetness with lots of musty grape juice.  It is fairly tart with lactic acid.  The smarties come through in the taste as well.  The finish is drying with more grape juice.  There as also a slight astringency.  Medium body.  Medium-low carbonation.  This beer is certainly unique and very good.  The Don lives up to the hype.",0.0,0.9856
Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Sampled March 2011; RBWG

The beer pours with a pale, wispy head that sits on top of a pale-purple tinged, amber colored beer. The nose has a really foxy (as in wild grape) note that sort of leans towards Concord grapes up front. There is a back note of mustiness, more moldy character, and some plastic-phenolic funkiness. It smells nicely tart, with more lactic notes than anything, but definitely some other acids round things out here as well. A butyric and goat-muskiness lightly touches the finish of the aroma.



As the beer first hits my mouth it tastes tart, but then gets more sharp and sour as it rolls across the tongue. This has a big, sharp, sourness in the end, but it is not acetic; some of the acidity must be from the grapes, as it is not entirely lactic in character. Linger flavors of foxy grapes melds with musky, and slightly moldy notes, as well as a touch of phenols that are almost plastic like in character. The plastic notes get a bit more prominent as the beer warms up. This is very dry, quite funky and the lemon-like tartness help immensely as well. A Brettanomyces signature plays a big role here, but part of the funkiness certainly comes from the particular grapes use. This is very light and quaffable (at least if you really like sours), but doesn’t come off as being watery or thin.



This is really nice, I would have loved to have had more, but this is certainly an awesome way to start off a grand tasting event. I like that this is super tart, and it is just so nicely evocative of musky, foxy, grapes and funk. This beer has definitely inspired me to find more funky, foxy, indigenous / wild grape varieties to use in Sour beers of my own; the signature that the grapes have left on this beer is just so interesting and intriguing.",0.0,0.9976

Review #600

Vintage 2008
Bottle 64L

A: The appearance is radiant orange/red, akin to grape juice. The beer has a small head and leaves just a trace of lacing, typical of a Cantillon lambic.

S: The aroma is fantastic, with a balance of classic Cantillon funk and freshly squeezed grape juice.

T: Like the aroma, the flavor is grape juice and funk. The beer is not overly sour or funky, but I certainly would not describe it as sweet, even though grapes / grape juice are very prominent.

M: Medium thin bodied. The aftertaste is fantastic. The balance of funk and lambic flavors with fruit is wonderful.

D: A pleasure to drink. I could have sipped this all night, if only that were possible.",0.06454972243679027,0.9904
Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Been waiting a long time for this day. My biggest personal whale for as long as I can remember. Pours a cloudy pinkish brownish red...kinda resembles a grapefruit in color actually. Small white head of tight, white bubbles. Nose is explosive fruit, specifically a mix of welch’s grapes and grapefruit. I don’t know where people were getting the shit/dirty diaper notes on this before, I think this smells amazing.  Doesn’t have as much of the Cantillon funk I expected. Flavor is incredibly tart, there is still a good amount of grape present, but I’ve been told its faded quite a bit since the last bottle the group had opened. There is some light lemon, but again, a lot less than a typical Cantillon offering. Light mouthfeel, good acidity, good carbonation, and a long finish. Such a great experience! I was skeptical that it wouldn’t hold up to the hype, but this beer is incredible. I think I need to follow through on getting one for the cellar.

The aroma has lots of unrefined wood, body odor, dirty grapes, light sourness and bugginess - this didn’t give me high hopes.  The body is light/medium as is smooth by the breweries standards along with mild carbonation.  The taste starts off with a husky/grainy quality that has a sweet/tart taste that’s very buggy and highly acidic.

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Opened by Thorpe429, thanks -- huge want of mine and a pretty good grape lambic. 

Beer is pinkish / purple and hazy with a thin diffuse head of tiny bubbles that don’t leave any lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to low. Looks pretty good for a sour.

Aroma is fruity, like grapes with a sulfurish (not in a bad way) undertone and mild lactic sourness. I was expecting some more acetic, it was there but I’m not sure why I thought this would be vinegar. 

Beer is light in body and has a mild sweetness to it, its lactic and acetic sour with hints of citric acid as well. Its not too complex, not getting a lot of grass or hay but there is a mild oakiness to it but without the vanilla, more the funk. Its nice and easy to drink.

Shared with Sean, Mike, and Alex on an awesome Sunday afternoon...375ml bottle into a Lost Abbey glass...Pours a light and bubly purple, kind of dark out but nothing special...The aroma is the best sour ever. It has the smoothest but deepest funk ever, almost manure like but in an appealing way. The first funk that actually really brings me back to the smell of visting my grandparents ranch in Texas. What makes this aroms even better is that its balanced nice with sweet smell of grapes a perfect combo to break up the depths of the funk...The taste thankfully picks up for the most part where the aroma left out. Funk is there but now the grapes come through more, a touch to much of the grapes. 

This is a top beer by far and must get for all Cantillon lovers, no matter the cost. I’d love to have this again side by side with blabaer just to see which of these is truly not only the best Cantillon but best sour in the world. Yeah, its that good.

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Bottle shared generously by BOLTZ7555, you rock man! Drank at RBWG. One of the most unusual beers I’ve ever had. Pours a cloudy bright red/pink hue with a medium white head. Lots of carbonation. The strangest nose ever; huge rotting decayed fruit, almost no normal person would smell this beer and think it was nice, it’s a funky rotting smell that dominated some nice woody fruit. The flavor though is much different; quite tart, but a burst of sweet fruit, grapes for sure, but there is sweeter fruit suggested, sour and woody, quite sour at points, nearing quite acidic.

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"2008 Bottle opened January 2011.



A: Slightly hazy orange-red with perhaps a slightly purplish hue. Small, but tightly-packed bubble-filled head. Spotty lacing.



S: Unique grape aroma. Best way to describe it is that wonderful Welches grape jelly aroma. Light acidic citrus undercurrents. A little oak and must. Some miscellaneous berries as well that are a little tough to identify with all that grape jelly.



T: Damn. I love this. Its like Blabaer in the sense that the uniqueness of the flavor is pretty close to mind-blowing. Like the nose tons of grape jelly, raspberries, lemon, wood, must, funk. 



M: A slight sweetness up front followed by a drying finish. Medium to light bodied. Even effervescence. Not overly sour and puckering, but there is plenty of acidity there to keep a sour-head happy.



O: A truly unique Cantillon offering. Certainly one of my favorites. The only question is... what the hell do I do with my last bottle... drink or cellar?",0.06274558051381586,0.9888

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"Very excited to be able to try this one. 375mL bottle.

Pours a bit lighter than cranberry juice. Maybe a slight golden tint, but not much--this is pretty much all red. Absolutely gorgeous color. Nice thin white head and some lacing as it goes down. Nose brings forth plenty of sour grapes along with some Brett and a bit of sourness. Also some hay and oak in there. The flavor really accentuates the grapes, and leaves the funk and the sourness in the background. I really like where it ended up. Mouthfeel is nice, as the interplay between the fruit flavors and the funky sourness are really carried by the carbonation. Drinkability is really quite great, as this finds a very nice balance between fruit, funk, and sour.

Pours reddish orange, topped with a thin off-white head. Nice red grape aroma. There are notes of grape juice and perhaps cranberry as well. Aroma is only moderately lactic. Red grape and grape juice are the predominant flavors, with complexity added by a moderate amount of lactic acid and notes of earth, raspberry and plum.

The color is hazy reddish-copper and the white head leaves a thick white ring on the glass.  Good lacing.

The aroma is interesting - red grapes, funk, earth, and cobwebs.

The flavor has a lot in common with Welch’s grape juice, but in a very good way. Concord grape, goat blanket, and typical Cantillon funk.

Nice palate - medium acidity with medium body and somewhat lively carbonation.

Very good fruit lambic overall.  Justifies the hype for the most part.",0.0,0.9685
Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"750ml bottle courtesy of Masterski.



Funny things, these Italian grapes. They’re similar to Concord grapes, which are what Welch’s uses for their eponymous grape juice. And I could not get that out of my head.



Though I did try: Don Quijote looks different, being copper colored and carbonated. And it smells.. uh.. kind of different, like leather, pepper, geosmin, and gravel. And Welch’s grape juice. Wave upon wave of that musky grape fluid.



The taste is mostly juice, underwritten by Cantillon’s signature sweaty fetlock, yellow woodsorrel, and oak barrel. Some residual sweetness coats the mouth.



A nice effort, especially if you’re a fan of Welch’s. Some age would do it good.",0.0,0.9506

Cantillon Don Quijote🇧🇪Lambic - Flavored,"In short: A surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink complex fruit lambic.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Shared with my Florence buddy, Andrea.  You’re the man Andrea!!!

The look: Cloudy dark orange-red body topped by short lived beige head

In long: Nose is medium funky with a nice rich fruity character.  Taste is smoother than most Cantillon I’ve had.  The fruits take a lot of room in this beer.  It is brewed with grapes but grapes is the not the fruit I would have named first.  The taste has a lot of tropical fruits (pineapples, mandarins, grapes, etc.) and also strawberries and the likes.  The sourness and acidity level is medium (which means low for a Cantillon) and the beer is surprisingly easy to drink by big sips, something I rarely do with a Cantillon.  The beer is excellent but still very fresh.  As it is right now it is an average Cantillon, I’ll open another bottle in a few years and I’m expecting great things.  The fruit character of this beer is awesome, it just needs to develop more acidity and dryness, something that most Cantillons develop with age.

MBCC2017 Backlog. Pours a dark ruby/purple with no head or carbonation. This is in a lot of ways similar to it's regular version but manages to pack in even more tastes. It still has that intense, fruit jam concentrate berry presence of raspberry, blueberry, blackberry. In this version it's a bit more subdued though. Less fruit sweetness and more of a deep rich caramel, fudge, vanilla input from the barrel. Tartness has stepped aside for more tannic oak qualities. The barrel gives this lovely complexity that has an almost earthy note to it yet is unremarkably present in it's sweetness.

Pours a cloudy, bright golden yellow color with a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lace left behind. 

The aroma of this beer is pretty remarkable. It’s just bursting with fresh tropical fruit notes while being countered by lactic funk, bready yeast and citrus. Lots of mango, papaya, pineapple and other tropical fruits but it still smells like a Berliner. A decent amount of earthy funk, wheat/bread and a touch of citrus balance things out.

Medium bodied with an explosion of tropical fruit notes that linger over subtle funk and acidity into a dry finish. Similarly to the aroma, there is a ton of amazing tropical fruit flavor but it still has the qualities of a berlinerweisse. A bit sweet perhaps but there is still some wheat/bready yeast flavor along with subtle acidity and lactic funk countering the fruit notes. Refreshing and delicious.",0.056980288229818966,0.9764

La Face Cachée de la Pomme Neige Récolte d'Hiver🇨🇦Apple Cider - Ice / Fire / Fortified,"Bottle in Seattle. Rainy night tasting. Huge thanks to Laurence for finding a bottle of this for me. A fantastic treat, tried immediately after the Premiere. Gorgeous dark cognac orange pour. Still, heavy body. Fascinating red apple aroma, exoticly fresh and lightly tropical. A hint of alcohol. First sip: wow. So rich and astoundingly delicious. Apple umami. Creamy, swirling sweet syrup. A touch of spice from alcohol, which perfumes everything. Complex, deep apple notes that I didn’t know existed in nature. Treacle, nut-apricot turkish delight, honey depth. Sweet without being overbearing. A lightly toasted tobacco edge, much darker notes than the Premiere. This just makes me think of Turkey for some reason. Delicious treat.",0.07071067811865475,0.9943

First tried this as Frimas from Joe McPhee at the RBSG 2010 Grand Tasting. It was so damn good in my tiny sample that I had to go and get a bottle via trade with cfrancis.



Poured out a lovely gold elixir that slid out of the bottle. Wide, slow sexy legs melt back into the silky concoction. The aroma is freaking succulent and drool inducing. Endless apples, none with a sour hint, deep sweetness that amazes, the faintest of alcohol, pure heaven - I do not know what else to say about the aroma - it is not complex aside from the depth of the apple goodness - simple wonderful. The taste is unreal. Satisfying to no end. Sweet apple fruit, thick sugar goodness, hint of alcohol and a tart bite that comes in near the end and then sneaks away until the next sip. Very rich and maybe a wood character but I’m only half convinced at that claim. Ooozes across my palate and sticks to everything leaving a velvety coating that can be worn down by sucking - and even that is something to look forward to.

Clear golden yellow in appearance with micro bubbles in suspension and very liqueur-like in appearance because the imprint of the movement of my glass leaves a beautiful trace still visible. Complex aroma of candied and exotic fruits: apple, pear, orange and passion fruit with a slight smell of ginger. Very classy in the mouth! We can taste ginger, cooked apple, caramel, cane sugar and salt and yes salt. A pleasure with each sip: roundness, thickness, well-hidden alcohol, oiliness and above all finesse. The salty comes back again and is very special when warming up, I have the impression of eating an apple pie. I also taste the cinnamon and more salt. Wow, for the first time I can allow myself to say that I am experiencing a moment of fullness with a cider. A purchase that I will make every year to let age in my cellar for a good 10 years.

How: Many times.  Lately I had the three Face Cachée de la Pomme classics (Neige, Neige Éternelle and Frimas) side by side at Montreal’s Flaveurs, Bières and Caprice Festival 2007.

The look: Stale orange body with no head

In long: The most easily drinkable (dangerously drinkable) of the Face Cachée lineup.  Flavour is concentrated apple juice (as opposed to the apple skins taste of the Neige) and adds touches of apricot.  A bit more syrupy than the others with more of an marmalade/applesauce flavour.

Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations I’ve ever sampled.",0.0,0.9782

Aroma of cinnamon, cloves, sweet apple skins and pulp, rich butter pie-crust with freshly baked, warm apples and a glass of brandy.  Vanilla and almonds in there as well.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"750 mL bottle. Unknown original review date, but sometime before June 26, 2012.
Jet black with a chocolate head. Inky and glass staining as always.

Whiskey is very dominant on the nose. All the flavors of whiskey, chocolate, and peppers come through in one whiff. They blend seamlessly into a great nose.

Tastes of whiskey up front, as the aroma would indicate. It’s a different aroma from Bourbon, which I didn’t quite expect. I thought I wouldn’t be able to discern a Whiskey barrel from a Bourbon barrel in a big beer like this. It’s less intense than a Bourbon barrel and allows the beer to come through. Chocolate and peppers not as well blended as in the aroma. The whiskey flavor is very sharp, especially in the finish.

Very thick. Seems to have retained its body better than Virgin Oak did. Very heavy and tough to drink. A sipper, I suppose.
Wonderful flavors, but it’s so big. The complexities of Hunahpu are a little lost from the barrel, but the barrel does well to accommodate.",0.0,0.9262

Black engine oil color leaving a light oily and golden filament on the glass, the latter fades quickly. The mocha-colored neck dissipates quickly.
Aroma here keeps all the generous bouquet of Hunahpu as I remember it. Malty, rich chocolate collide with notes of spices followed by a woody roundness of whiskey giving a sweet vanilla hint. Caramel on the toffee side. The heat of the peppers remains moderate but adds a subtle bouquet that keeps a hint of spice with the reinforcement of cinnamon.
Palate is simply sublime. Chocolate is deep and thick on a light spice that comes to tickle each sip.
The whiskey is soft, roundness of the typical American woodiness which gives a beautiful vanilla sweetness in the mouth. The latter accompanies a very complex palate. Find a generous and thick chocolate enhanced by this fine heat of peppers. The whole covers a hint of smoke that follows at the end of the mouth.
Only negative point, beer to drink at room temperature but which when warming begins to take on notes of soy.

Remains a unique beer, which is worth sharing. Large caliber to drink, what am I saying, to taste quietly. A taste experience. The whiskey is subtle, present but without dominating. This leaves the basic version enough room to shine while benefiting from maturing.",0.05063696835418333,0.9827

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Appearance:
Blacker than black with a paper thing espresso crema head which fizzles into oblivion. Sucked in by a black whole maybe? Rests still and unwavering with a few trepid swirls leaving a black oily slick in its wake.


Nose:
Burnt black licorice. Pure unfettered cacao – brittle, bitter, roasty, and burnt espresso caramel crema. Sweet heat and spice along the sides and rounding out in the back. Whiskey soaked black chocolate covered raisins. Black cake.


Palate:
Intense but not intensely complex. Dark chocolate fudge and brownies. A silky mouthfeel carries each delicate flavor from beginning to finish. Spicy heat tickles the back of my throat with whisky and the cask it was previously aged int. Black root and more fudge mingle. Oily on the lips while dry and brittle on the tongue – cacao beans.


Final Thoughts:
Between the Rum and the Whiskey, I enjoyed both but if I had to lean in one direction, it would be in the direction of the rum. Both were amazing beers though and while I don’t know what new used barrel deliciousness Cigar City has in store for their next Hunahpu release, I’ll have to make sure I am there and ready.",0.0,0.9643

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"A-- Pours like Hunahpu does. Thick, sludgy, oily, and black. Just huge. Beautiful reverse cascading head. Went from black leather to a dark mocha colored head. Two finger head that settled to a thick film. Just gorgeous looking. Big oily residue of ABV legs and sediment. Good spotty lacing. 

S-- Yikes. Chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon,an nutmeg. Barrel notes were soft but did get vanilla, oak, and carmel. Really thought the base beer somewhat overshadowed the barrel. Not complaining though. 

T-- Thick and rich. Massive array of flavors. Vanilla, chocolate fudge, marshmallow, cinnamon, oak, vanilla and carmel. Like drinking a thick milkshake.

M-- Thick and oily. Big but not overly big or sweet at all. Quite smooth really and still chewable at the same time. Low carbonation. What was really memorable was the chillies really made an impact in this. As in the heat in the mid an back palate. Had heartburn the next day from it. Nice touch. 

O-- Outstanding beer in every respect. Would have liked more of the barrel but in this beer it is more about the spices and what it adds. Yeah, I am a Stranahan homer and like the barrel treatments from them. Was quite fun to drink and would love to try again.",0.05089865985592875,0.9952

Pours pitch black with a dark mocha head that quickly settle into a thick, lasting ring. Sporadic streaks of lace left behind. 

Strong barrel character in the aroma aroma with a prominent whiskey presence. Subtle toasted oak with sweet and roasted malt notes underneath.  Hints of chocolate, toffee, hazelnut and coffee.  Subtle vanilla and peppers.  Peppers seem to be muted by this treatment. 

Thick bodied and viscous with a strong barrel presence that gives off lots of whiskey and toasted oak that dominates the flavor.  Some vanilla and toasted coconut as well.   The strong barrel flavors are followed by sweet and roasted malts that become more prominent as it warms.  Lots of chocolate with a mix of sweet and roasted notes along with some coffee bean, caramel and toffee.  The cinnamon and peppery heat show up toward the finish but again are slightly muted by the strong whiskey flavor.  Decent amount of heat but abv is nicely masked.  Another solid Hunahpu treatment.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"From notes.  First reviewed 10/31/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Taste side by side with 2011 Hunahpu’s and the Virgin Oak Aged Hunahpu’s.

The pour is a gorgeous chocolate ebony color with a tightly wound chocolate colored creamy head. Eventually fading to a collar, a little bit of lace is left down the sides of the glass.

I did not think that Hunahpu’s aroma could improve, but aging in these whiskey barrels managed to do it. Sweet whiskey, dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, and a bit of coffee blend and balance ever so nicely.

The flavor is phenomenal as well. Dark chocolate works in with sweet whiskey flavors, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, a bit of espresso and cream. Some light dry oak tannins come in toward the middle, mixing with more chocolate and whiskey toward the end. 

With an incredibly thick body, the flavors really have a chance to settle on the tongue. The carbonation is on the light side, which really lets all of the flavors come through. A strong sticky flavor rests on the tongue and lips.

S - The whisky is the perfect compliment to the base beer. The chili notes, smooth booze, oak, vanilla and chocolate are excellent. The spices aren’t all too forward, but you can pick them out, if you concentrate. 

T - Excellent stuff. I don’t really pick out any chili, but the chocolate sweetness of the base beer mixed with the whiskey is just delicious! Burnt sugars, oak, vanilla, chocolate, smooth booze and light char. All work together wonderfully.

M - Full body, rich and smooth, motor oil, creamy finish.

O - My favorite of the 2011 variants but not quite as good as the Brandy version from 2010. I think this will be even better in a year or so, as the booze is still pretty in-your-face (yet still excellent). Would search out again for sure!",0.06375767130633382,0.9934
Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Tasted side-by-side with regular, Bourbon, Rum, and Virgin Oak. Thanks to everyone for making this happen. Served in a Cigar City snifter.

Pours a deep brown color with a thin light mocha head. Small cap and a bit of lacing. The nose carries some faint whiskey along with backing chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, and chiles. The base beer is much more prominent here than in the Rum and Bourbon versions. The flavor has a good whiskey backing plus chocolate, roast, and some nice spicing. Medium body with good carbonation. Quite tasty, but not quite at the level of the other barrel-aged blends. Boom.",0.0,0.7681

Beer is black with a thin brown head with some lacing, decent retention, moderate to low carbonation.

Aroma is sweet, oaky, strong liquor aroma, definitely bourbon / whiskey in the nose, quite strong.

This beer has a mild bite to it, strong, thinner than the virgin oak, boozier too, the whiskey and oak flavors sit on top of the backbone of the beer, interesting. The liquor is almost an after thought in this one, my third favorite of the night.",0.0,0.9638

Mouthfeel: Silky thick , spicy bubbles.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Stranahan's Whiskey Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"750 ml bottle from fishingnet. Thanks, Ben! Pours a rich thick blackish hue, dark and black ominous. Opaque and inky. A thicker dark brown head sits atop, cakes and laces well. Aromas are chocolate chip cookies, some whiskey, oak, vanilla, and gentle spice. Some mellow vanilla, lots of cocoa, roasty and sweet caramel, toffee, and biscuits. Gentle toast. Vanilla and touches of cinnamon touch, but pepper seems muted. A touch of butter and creamy caramel. Initial is thick and big, an enveloping way of cocoa and caramel, roast and toast. Whiskey, vanilla and oak tannins, gentle spirit. Big and rich, offering some good big flavors. A bit sweet. Into the middle touches of spice and more sweet and barrel presence, the pepper doesn’t show up till the finish and lingers a bit. Gentle spice, mellow whiskey, big sweet and roasty melange of flavors. The ashy and roast, some smoke and gentle pepper picks up in finish and lingering on. Still covers up the cinnamon too much. The barrel is well executed and plays well, but I still think the barrel and aging with this beer covers up some of the best stuff about Hunah. Very nice. Significantly thicker and sweeter than the base 2011. Still love the base more but this is a very nice beer. The nuance of the regular is just lost fairly easily here, some pepper still remains but all that life from the cinnamon and toast, vanilla and even pepper strength. Great beer.. But when you drink it side-by-side with the base, it’s just hard to compare.",0.08006407690254355,0.9978

Again with a thick viscous pure deep black hue and topped with a moderate darker tan head that receded to a thin ring around the edges of the glass... Butterscotch and caramel upfront in the aroma with softer more mellow whiskey notes. Vanilla surfaces more through the middle and finish.  Soft to moderate pepper nicely finishes things off... Flavors fail to deviate much from the aroma with solidified with charred chocolate oites to pair alongside a soft gentle whiskey presence. A light to medium pepper presence meshes nicely late and prolongs through the finish. Thick consistency throughout. Nicely executed. Original > whiskey > virgin oak at this point.,0.0,0.9062

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"12oz bottle from Canal's, 2017 marked on the label (PKG 10/05/2017), 11.2% abv for this round. Nose is room filling barrel character (oak / Bourbon?) and somewhat lesser chocolate and coffee. Pour straight pitch with a surprisingly large rocky tan head. Taste is dominated by barrel character and alcohol, some heat, some mild burn, but spirited and fumy without heavy fusel contribution -- I'm impressed if that was the goal. Deep warmth along the throat, touch sugary but never sweet, per se; lower bitterness than expected, probably low-medium or even just plain low; dark roast, inky dark malt character that's unfortunately marred/surpassed by oily alcohol. Medium body with light edges but the flavors are just sledgehammers. Clean throughout, hint of yeast here and there, no soy. There's a bit of fruit, mostly grape, pairing very nicely with cream (in taste and texture), espresso aftertaste, but the overall effect is closer to a marriage of Slivovitz and Kahlua than beer. That being said, a reasonably fun one, if expectations have been adjusted. [2018.08.03: 3.9]",0.0,0.8526

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Appearance: Black, light dark brown head, low retention, small bubbles moderately active, fine lace. 

Nose: Bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, fudge, coffee. 

Taste: Bourbon barrel and chocolate dominant, roasted malt, finish very distinct from the aromas of quality coffee. Still sweet, slight bitterness. 

Sensation: Medium body, good length, spicy touch on the tongue. 

In short: For me, this beer has two great qualities. First, the balance of roasted malty notes, aromatic contributions from the barrel, residual sugar and bitterness. A beautiful mastery. Then, the transition between the mentioned notes and a very distinctive finish on coffee is very interesting. Beautiful complexity.

Inky, ebony with very little light making it through the edges. No head, even after a vigorous pour and some warming....
So at a full six years of age, you can't really fault a beer for being well past its prime. That being said, this was specifically designed to lay down, which I did, since acquiring it young, in a wine fridge. So I was, I think understandably/justifiably, VERY disappointed when this thing was just plain DEAD. I mean, I could understand if it was well past its prime or something, but this was just fully oxidized soy sauce. Will certainly get a bottle to rerate and just put in an average placeholder score.

In taste, the beer is thick, oily and very smooth on the tongue. Each sip seems to fill the entire oral cavity, dominating with its taste. Dark chocolate, coffee and dried fruit create a beautiful composition. They are complemented by aftertastes associated with barrel aging - vanilla and coconut.

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Appearance: Pours an inky, black body with a sustained, light sandy-beige head.

Smell: Char-hinting heavy roastiness with a crust of bitter dark chocolate, with lesser touches of dark fruit, vanilla-infused molasses, woodsiness and peppery alcohol.

Taste: Bulky roastiness, a bit ashen and chary and laden with booziness and soy. Rolls sweet to bitter (charred) with a salient, less-than-satisfying alcohol presence coupled with woody tannins. A bit of dark chocolate, licorice, gummy molasses and prune. The nose held a bit more promise, though the heavy char, soy and booze leave it lopsided and unbalanced.

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"The 6th RIS in the world drunk on the last day of 2016. I welcomed the New Year in great style.

The legend returns with the double force of bourbon barrels.

A beer I have been hunting for for years. It cost me a lot of effort to finally get it.

And how much my man in the US had to go through, only he knows. He managed to get it in one, only place in New York.

Thanks again Wojtek Zawadzki for your involvement.

Alcohol: 10.8% vol.

Date of bottling: 07.01.16

Color: Black as tar, completely opaque.

Foam: Dense, beige, high, stiff like well-whipped cream.
It creates one layer of fluff. It rolls perfectly on the glass.
It falls into a cloud.
After swirling the glass, it goes up, leaving hundreds of dots on the walls.

Scent: I put the tip of the bottle to my nose and after a few moments I say to myself: ""Breathe deeply, don't faint"".

No words can describe even a part of this aroma.

A colossal vanilla, an overwhelming coconut, gigantic influences of wet oak, wood, rotten boards.

The barrel notes paralyze the senses and leave you stunned.

After digging out from under this huge barrel armor, other aromas slowly start to reach the brain.

And there is plenty of it. Intense Swiss chocolate, pralines with alcohol inside, notes of the best coffee in the world, molasses, brownie, brownie cake, crème brûlée, panna cotta and a whole bunch of other brilliant and sweet desserts known to me.
Pulp! Awesome! Undisputed 10/10!

Taste: After the first sip, I was simply speechless.
Bourbon did such an incredible job here.
Tons of vanilla, colossal coconut, oak, caramel, wood, chocolate, Belgian pralines, espresso, walnuts, meringues from beaten egg whites, crème brûlée again.
What else is there here.
The texture is dense, oily, thick like jelly.
The bitterness is surprisingly high, but short with a nutty-coffee background.
Almost 11% alcohol warms the chest and pleasantly tickles the palate. Smooth, creamy, velvety. The mouthfeel is simply fabulous.
A masterful, tasting, refined drink. A hit like no other!

Carbonation: Low.

Summary:

December 31, 2016 - I will remember this date for a long time. After drinking over a hundred RISs, I have found
my ideal style.
Black Note is an OUTSTANDING beer.

I have never encountered a RIS with such a complex taste and aroma, at the same time so balanced, creamy and with such a powerful barrel vanilla and coconut.
The beer is worth every penny. If only I could, I would get on a plane to the USA and travel across the States in search of this drink.

There is nothing better than ending this year in such a spectacular style.

I wish you all for this New Year 2017, that each of you finds your ideal.",0.0,0.9942

2014 bottle poured into a snifter showing pitch black with no head but a light latte bubbly center.

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"330 ml bottle. Looks mega viscous and pours pitch black with a creamy beige head.

Substantial sweetness, but pretty nicely balanced and bourbon is subtle ish on tasting. Some carbonation but defo soft. Crazily long finish with plenty of sweetness, very pleasant bitterness and lots and lots of bourbon. Can understand the hype, but I would probably take good ol expedition over this. Bit of a barrel bomb. As bottle goes on it turns into a bit of a bourbon fug. Bourbon BAged beers get inflated scores on ratebeer - don’t drink the Kool-Aid.

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Beer geeks around the world celebrated International Stout Day yesterday, so I decided to dig into the cellar to find one of the most exclusive ones I have left. I expect a lot from this one seen its reputation... ’Vintage’ bottle (2014). Loudly crackling, moussy, deep tan coloured head, retaining fairly well (even remaining completely stable around the edge) over an opaque and practically black, but actually very dark chestnut brown beer (becoming increasingly apparent as the glass is emptied) with visible fizz on the edges. Strong aroma upon opening the bottle, offering everything one expects from a barrel aged RIS: thick whiffs of dark chocolate, espresso gone cold, coffee beans even, hazelnut paste, sweet cherries soaked in brandy, wet leather, bourbon, vanilla-like oak, raisins, salmiak, chocolate cake dough, very old madera, candied dates, soy sauce, bayleaf, stewed beef, cloves, gingerbread, pear syrup, black olives, Cuban cigars, it just goes on and on. Intense, thick, extremely rich taste, opening with a restrained and refined, dense candied sweetness perfectly balanced with soy sauce-like umami flavours and a soft, ’generic’ sourishness; mouthfeel is expectedly big and oily, full-bodied yet still elegant and supple, with a finely tingling carbonation perfect for this style. A slight alcohol warmth can be felt at an early stage but is largely drowned in an abyss of malts, with delicious dark bittersweet ’chocolateness’ prevailing over toasty and nutty flavours and the coffeeish roasted bitterness gently and gradually building towards the finish. Ends in a big, thick wave of this black maltiness, with the initial sweetness discretely balanced by not just the black coffee bean-like roasted bitterness, but lovely oaky ’woodiness’ as well, supporting peppery hop bitterishness in the right place. Alcohol is evident, but feels like a good bourbon or even rhum rather than being brutal and ’blank’; it brings a very agreeable wave of heat to the throat and chest without becoming obnoxious. Some sweetness lingers in the throat after swallowing but the roasted, hoppy and light alcohol bitterness dominate the aftertaste. The bouquet is just wonderful at cellar temperature and becomes even more enchanting, not to say addictive, at room temperature: this beer is completely flawless to me, I could not stop sniffing it for the whole duration of the tasting (of an entire bottle). Some other ’hyped’ American impies are equally impressive but are perhaps a tad too boastful; this one remains discrete and shows finesse and elegance galore. The ’sticky’ sweetness is exquisitely balanced, which is less the case in e.g. Dark Lord or Surly’s Darkness; the wood and the bourbon add another layer of complexity without disturbing the equilibrium of the basic beer’s malty, hoppy and fruity properties. This is a lot like BCBS in many ways, with the same degree of drinkability; I already gave Bell’s Expedition Stout a near perfect score, and since this one ups the ante with the extra dimension of bourbon barrel ageing, I guess I have no choice but to honor this artful masterpiece with a close to perfect score. This is a divine beer in all respects and the perfect choice for celebrating something as geeky as an international beer style day, I guess...",0.0634361479695551,0.9992

Bell's Black Note Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Originally reviewed 2/15/2012. On tap at Bx Beer Depot. A keg of Hopslam and a keg of Black Note. Amazingly, the Hopslam kicked long before the Black Note, so I enjoyed three of these as I watched people go nuts for Hopslam. Big khaki head. Not a particularly dark head, though. Decent retention. Huge barrel aroma. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Roasted chocolate, but otherwise the stout is a touch lost in the barrel. Boozy, too.

Taste is chocolate and a building tingle of bourbon. Vanilla flavor throughout. The chocolate comes back in the finish in a much more bitter manifestation. Less boozy in the finish that the smell would indicate. Really wonderful incorporation of barrel and stout.

Aroma is bursting chocolate and raisins, very complex roasted malt is up yo face, beneath that, a destinct bourbon barrel aroma with tons of oak and vanilla is present, and even further down are notes of black tea, ripe cherry and espresso. Magnificent aroma. The taste is somewhat surprising. I was expecting a much fuller mouthfeel given the aroma, but the beer comes out very dry for the style, and somewhat of an alcohol burn. The taste has notes of dark cherries, bitter chocolate, oak and roasted malts. The finish is bitter, and the alcohol taste sticks in the mouth. I guess I had an idea that this would be a very heavy, viscous and creamy imperial stout, and instead it is more on the dry and well-attenuated side of the spectrum. Even though it is something completely different from my expectations, I am enjoying this beer a lot.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"One of the most sought after versions of BCBS, vintage of 2013; my bottle says 14.1% ABV instead of the 13.9% ABV given above. I taste this special treat from an old port wine snifter at near room temperature. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, near to black but not entirely so; only in the last remnants of the liquid, a cloudy brown appearance reveals itself, with tiny bits of dead yeast and proteins lining the glass wall.  The head is thin, beautifully deep beige and a bit coarse, but is sadly reduced to an irregular, wafer-thin rim around the glass in instants. I passionately fall in love with the aroma: what a divine bouquet rises up from the bottle... I could sniff this for hours on end: deep dark chocolate sauce, raisins, candied figs, vanilla-like oaky tannins, Islay whisky, liquorice, old sherry, soy sauce, candied orange, eucalyptus syrup, espresso, cocoa powder, cedar wood, pear syrup, Worcestershire sauce, some cooked meat or fried eggs far away but not disturbing at all, and indeed a faint hint of coconut, though I suspect this volatile aroma has faded considerably in the course of almost two years. The taste amazes me even more: a complex and baffling experience indeed, starting off with a very dense, pointy, refined, concentrated, candied sweetness, cloying a bit to the lips, candied oranges, pear, dried dates and indeed a hint of dry coconut meat; a tinge of carbonation pierces through, as well as subtle sourish and salty accents (red berries and soy sauce). Then a profound chocolate maltiness unfolds in all its glory, bitter chocolate with caramel and cashew nuts, spreading over the tongue and mouth cavity, with a fat, oily mouthfeel; a wonderful symphony of sweet versus bitter, with a lively, almost faintly clove- and cinnamon-like spiciness to it (perhaps the rye whisky already speaking?). Bitter wins in the end, as - almost unexpectedly - a tangy yet still mellow roasted coffee ’blackness’ appears, almost cappuccino-like in combination with the bittersweet chocolate, warming and filling the back of the mouth. Even before I swallow the first sip, it is clear to me that this beer increases in complexity as it makes its way through the palate; the finish beautifully recaptures the whole taste trail from beginning to end, blending the candied sweetness, the bittersweet chocolate malts and the softly roasted coffee bitterness into one concentrated ’ball’ of taste, which is finally confronted with a big wave of warming, whisky-like alcohol which also remains on the tip of the tongue after swallowing but somehow manages to remain gentle in all its force; a clear, drying, tannin-like woodiness ensues, as well as a background hint of peppery, leafy, noble hops adding a subtle, double bass-like structure to the whole. The complexity and richness of the malts, including a warm sense of high quality, aromatic coffee and again the woody tannins, linger for hours after swallowing and the alcohol warms the heart... Things just keep happening here, no matter how many sips you’ve taken.  Though I have to admit I expected more coconut presence, this is still one of the most noble stouts I ever had the pleasure to enjoy. I particularly appreciate the follow-up of tastes in this one, sweet and bitter and bitter and sweet all make their appearance one by one only to lead to a resolving climax, as in a classical drama, though I did find the alcohol and the cloying sweetness perhaps a tad over the top - I had the same experience with AleSmith’s Speedway Bourbon Barrel Aged, and like in the case of the latter, this is the only thing keeping me from giving both stouts a perfect score.  Obviously, in view of this beer’s complexity and greatness, this is only the slightest form of criticism, if any; both remain unforgettable and both surely belong to the best beers I ever tasted.  This one, too, is a slow sipper for sure, to be treated with graciousness, dignity and respect. It is obvious that a lot of thought went into this beer; it is as if the malts were selected especially to fit in with the spirit of the barrel in which it has aged (and frankly, I would not be surprised if this is indeed deliberate). Fantastic example of the style, definitely worth the money (which was quite considerable, needless to say...). A world-class masterpiece, that is beyond doubt.

Pours a viscous, jet black color with no head, while some chunks of coconut float in the brew.

Sweet aromas of cane sugar, toffee, molasses, and burned coconut. These blend well into wooden, slightly boozy, hot barrel qualities, among bakers chocolate.

Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, super creamy, drinks like chocolate with loads of cocoa nibs and glazed, slightly burned coconut. The bourbon acts as an intriguing counterpart to that, providing wood and earthy maltiness without revealing any booziness, less intense than the sweeter parts of the stout, still easily balancing the beer. Instead of a noteable carbonation, there is smooth creaminess, heading into a mousse au chocolate direction. The Bourbon in this beer is by no means dominant on its own, but blends perfectly into the chocolate qualities.

Making a beeline for the Goose Island tent as soon as the gates opened I was able to get two pours of this amazing imperial stout. A world class release, this version of Bourbon County Stout made the ticket worthwhile on its own. While I am unlikely to pick up a bottle because of the cost I look forward to trying a few more at festivals and other special tappings.



Aroma / Appearance - An inky black base with long legs creeps from the pitcher into the glass. Anise, coffee, chocolate, and heavy booze rise into the air like dense smoke. Vanilla accents add even more depth. The Templeton Rye peeks out from time to time but due to the general heaviness does not stand out on its own.



Flavor / Palate - Strong malt, coffee, smoke, and Templeton Rye stick to the tongue and throat. Chewy after just a few seconds, the mouthfeel offers something for everybody as it crawls to a bitter warm finish. Despite all that it never feels suffocating. Six to eight ounces would be a perfect pour as I’m not sure I could finish much more on my own in one sitting without having a whole evening.",0.0,0.9365

usual black tar stout in a glass. Ink. Smells initially pretty weak, but probably because it is too cold. As it warmed the coconut really came through and paired well with the beer.

Pours a jet black with a minimal mocha colored head. Broke into spotty lacing, but had a very oily texture that coats the glass. Aromas were very sweet with chocolate and coconut jumping out but had the usual Bourbon County booze wafting from the glass as well. Taste was very, very big chocolate and loads of coconut in this one initially. Not being a big fan of coconut, I wished there was more char/roasted malt present across the middle. More chocolate joined forces with the bourbon to provide a pretty nice finish. Still, I thought it was a bit boozy.

 The appearance notes are basically the same, Opaque, oily, small minimal head or lace. Rich bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, coffee mocha, leather, tobacco, and burnt coconuts are the aroma and flavor profile notes. One thing that was different was that the tap offering seemed much heavier of both coconut and chocolate and less roasty notes.

The pour is a nice black, with a thick thick khaki head that doesn’t want to fade down in a hurry. This was the first pour, so I expected the head. The lacing is just beautiful! The aroma is big on cocoa and roasted malt. There is a beautiful hint of the rye whiskey in there, and not a whole lot of coconut. Molasses and dark fruits are also present on the back end. The nose on this is awesomely complex. The flavor is great as well. Hot damn. The thick, syrupy greatness has a ton of roast and a lightly sweet molasses. The coconut isn’t really overly present here until it warms up. The coconut comes through after it sits on the palate for a while. The mouth feel is thick and viscous with a great covering carbonation and it just beautiful.

Solid Pour courtesy of saultbauls. 

Pours basically black with a small head that pretty much just goes away. 



The aroma has plenty of coconut, woodiness, sweetness and bourbon. The alcohol is noticeable but less so than in regular Bourbon County Stout of this age & there is a surprising bit of dark fruit shining through here. 



The flavor is very sweet, it’s got plenty of coconut flavor which works well here in a sort of coconut cookie a’la vanilla and evaporated milk kind of way. There is also a hefty bourbon and boozy element here, again with the surprising dark fruit flavors similar to the aroma. 



The palate is of course huge and mouth coating.

Taste is a perfect mix of bourbon, chocolate, and light coconut. Really depends on the bottle you get for the amount of coconut. Full body, creamy, rich, smooth finish.



An excellent beer, but I would say drink sooner rather than later because I’m sure the coconut won’t be around for too long.",0.08164965809277258,0.8591
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"The beer appears like any other Bourbon County beer - deep black, viscous, small head that fades to nil. However, upon further inspection, I find tiny pieces of coconut floating on the surface. 

The aroma is fabulous. Bourbon, fudge, oak, roast, and all the character one expects from the standard Bourbon County. And then there’s the coconut. Wow. I really enjoy coconut / coconut desserts, so this beer is right up my alley.

The flavor is just phenomenal. An instant 5 rating for me. Coconut is front and center and just works beautifully in this beer. Like a chocolate macaroon. I haven’t had BCBS Rare in a while, but I do believe that this Proprietor’s variant is my favorite of the Bourbon County series. World class and well deserving of the high ratings.",0.0,0.9464
Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Big thanks to DocJ007 for sharing this one with us last night at our monthly tasting.




A - Pours pitch black with a nice one finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace on the sides of the glass.




S - Smells of strong sugary sweetness, fudge brownie mix, coconut, molasses, dark fruits, charred wood and plenty of fusel alcohol. The coconut is there but as it warms up the intense sweetness holds it down.




T - Starts off with the intense sugary sweetness - mainly the chocolate, molasses and raw cane sugar - quickly being joined by the strong coconut flavor, dark fruits, charred wood and plenty of warming booze burn. Finish is still really sweet with some mild burn, lingering long after the finish.




M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Heavy, sweet feel makes it hard to consume more than a few ounces at a time.




O - A really nice coconut stout, but I have had better in my travels. If the sweetness could be dialed back a bit I think this one could be amazing, since that won’t be happening anytime soon this remains just a very nice coconut stout.",0.0,0.996

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"November 19, 2013, 1007. 22 oz bomber into a tulip glass. Looking down the neck of the beer you can see chunks of coconut. Man is that a great sign! Pours the regular BCBS pitch black with a fizzing dark mocha head. Head retention is pretty weak due to the unreal level of coconut bits and oil. It’s actually chunky and leaves trails of black stained coconut. It might not be pretty, but it’s one of the coolest effects I’ve seen in a beer. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, huge vanilla and butterscotch presence. In the back is the toasted coconut and a touch of rye spice. Liquid almond joy! The taste is even better. It has all the makings of regular BCBS; chocolate, roast, heavy vanilla and oak/bourbon but the sweetness is amplified with a super pleasant real coconut layer. Thick and coating mouth feel. Boozy finish with a lingering syrupy stickiness. This might just be the best variant to date, right up there with Vanilla. Where as the fruited variants tend to muddle the base beer, the coconut here only compliments the base beer. The rye barrel provide a nice little spice as well.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Lovely beer that makes the perfect dessert. Creamy mouthfeel with a biding touch of alcohol.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"My Bottom Line:

Coconut thrives through this fun dessert of an Imperial Stout, swimming around chocolate and caramel flavours in an otherwise heavily sweet, complacent mouthfeel.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-There is no head of foam atop the darkness.

-The sweetness is prevalent and can get on your nerves quickly. Glad I got to split this bomber with a few likeminded aficionados.

-When the coconut subsides, this beer might reach better cohesion. For now, flavours are harmonious, but the flavour profile is not nearly as tight as it should be.

-The flatness and utter dominance of the coconut make this much less compelling than the ratings suggest.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"22 oz. bottle. There was a time in my life where I would spend a long time trying to track down a beer like this. I’d spend a day or two trying to track down bottles of a hard to find beer for friends and trades. It’s funny: I’d actually stress myself out about tracking down a bottle. Some where. Anywhere. Walking into stores and asking, ""Do you have it?"" to be greeted by a tired and cranky beer salesman saying for the hundredth time, ""No.""

I look back at those times both positively and negatively. Sure, the hunt was thrilling. But the stress? How foolish I must have looked? Here I am, now fully employed and I can’t take off to hunt down rare beerz. I was fortunate enough to track down a bottle or two of this late November of 2013 whale.

Mild almond milk and dark chocolate, touches of barrel and booze. Some cold pressed coconut oil, coco, and vanilla. Flavor is sweet with mild saltiness and umami notes. Sweet, boozy, but not sugary.

Lots to like on the smell with the fudgy chocolate dominating. Flavor is massive fudge, a bit if rye whiskey spiciness heat up front on the to the tongue. There is a nice roasty component to this, some definite vanilla, and very subdued coconut. I was expecting more coconut punch but the fudge flavor really takes over. Nevertheless this differs from regular BCBS and I suspect there is a nuance from the coconut that provides this sweet yet roasted finish that takes it above the regular version. No doubt this is one of the best BA stouts I have had. Really sits alongside CBS with a similar sweetness level and without the coffee. Big, rich, thick mouthfeel, perfect lowish carbonation.

Sweet bourbon , vanilla oak, brownie chocolate batter and roasted barley. As far as the mouthfeel goes it was a bit more oily and slick then other variations of BCS. They served us a coconut macaroon with this sample and it pair really damn nice with it. But I feel like I got more coconut from the desert then I did from this stout. The brew master also stated that aging this variant would not be a good idea since the coconut was sure to fade. They had to experiment it get this nuance in the stout in the first place so with that being said drink this young. Don’t hoard it or try to trade half your beer cellar for it.

Goose Island Bourbon County Stout - Proprietor's 2013🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"draft at Stout, Chicago. Pours slick black with very small head around the rim. The first thing I noticed is that I can’t smell coconut anywhere, had to search long and hard and for the most part, didn’t pick it up. What it did smell like was some of the best regular BCS ever, great balance between chocolate and oak-bourbon notes. Flavor again was hard pressed to find coconut, the closest I got was getting a bit more marshmallowy goodness with perhaps a faint toasted coconut here, again it tasted right, good body to this, fairly thick with lots of charred barrel, chocolate, and some roast. Some of the tightest BCS I’ve had but overall it’s a fail because they put the word coconut in the description and you might not have guessed it otherwise. I’ll have to see if the bottles have a bigger coconut presence. Coconut explosion? Really? Maybe the bottles are different.

I have to say, this actually lives up to the hype. And holy crap there is a lot of hype surrounding this. If you have multiples and plan on drinking one, probably best to do it now, this is good to go, cant imagine it getting any better.  





7/17/14 Was at room temp for a few months and then in my fridge for a few months. Everyone said the coconut would be gone in 6 months. Well it’s about 1/4 of what it was. Which is still a decent amount of coconut.  But not to say that this turned to regular bourbon county. It’s almost as if the coconut broke down into sugar. Super sweet, touch of bourbon. Still great, not mind blowing amazing. Not changing the score, because it was supposed to be consumed fresh. Glad I was able to try it several times.",0.0,0.9701

Like the others from the series, I think it’s an awesome mead and a flavor bomb - it’s really really good - but it’s a mead that I could not drink in ""large"" quantity (6 to 8 oz would be the upper limit I think) and it doesn’t have the balance and fruit depth of the best Schramm’s meads despite their score on RB being similar. Wait a minute, am I complaining while I give a 4.2 to this mead?",0.0,0.9883

Once you settle into it though you start to get the full picture of how good this is. My favourite of the series thus far.

Toppling Goliath SR-71 Blackbird (2015 Bottling / Draft)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Bottle, shared by kind souls, in a location remote of my dining room. 

Pours pitch black with a small but well retained head. 



The aroma is a bit overly woody at first, but as it opens up it’s really got a nice chocolate & raisin thing going on. The light booze, big raisin, super rich and nicely woody thing remind me a lot of Pedro Ximénez, in fact blindfolded I might think this was PX going strictly on aroma. 



The flavor is big on woodiness and booze, but there are some nice toasted marshmallow, caramel, and vanilla things going on. As it warms it gets a little more fudge like and gets a nice little bit of raisin in there too. 



The mouthfeel is heavy, as it should be....

A thick viscuous inky black pour from the bottle with sizable starkly chocolate dark head. A good layer dies down to a thicker film with good retention and lacing. Aromas are cocoa and earth, barrel and roast. Touches of vanilla, spirit and faint coconut intermix with caramel, biscuit and earth. Jabs of coffee, cocoa and deeper decadent sweetness come on. Lovely and rich. Initial is offers a firmer body, caramel and oak meet toffee, cocoa and roast. Coffee and espresso come on with jabs of vanilla, nice warming barrel that doesn’t interfere. Lushious, fudgey and a nice coffee element as we keep moving. The barrel is well integrated here, offering some mellow warmth, firmer vanillin and oak elements. The thick big body beneath is properly thinned, offering a complex mélange of rich flavors. Mocha, caramel, and fudge with a richer coffee element as we hit the backend. Great flow, flavor, good body and barrel ratio. Opened this with some friends who had indulged at Hunah Day in Tampa and said this was a completely different beer compared to the stuff they offered on tap in Florida, an offering at the time they thought was pretty lacking.

2017 Vintage Bottle (A Mounted Police Officer on the Horse)
Ridiculously dark brown coloured body, almost an oily black coloured body without much transparency at all (some at the edges when tilted) and a nice three centimetre tall rich light brown and deep tan head on top that stays afloat for a while and leaves a nice lace on the side as it fades. Aroma of very strong chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, oatmeal, molasses, alcohol and the strongest here - maple syrup (just as it should be) with a great finish of warm alcohol and sugars in the nose - very strong smelling, indeed. Full-bodied; Rich, super sweet and decadent maple syrup, woodsie, bourbon and roasted malt notes dominate up front with a lot of residual sugars from pitted fruits, molasses and toffee with a pungent malt backbone that really brings out the oats and grainy notes with some slight nutty and woodsie flavours, but the roasted oatmeal and rich coffee notes really penetrate the sugars here with a nice balance to bring out the strong sugars at the end and some alcohol warmth at the finale to make this FEEL nice as well. Aftertaste is super potent and rich a lot of alcohol, a ton of roasted malts and oatmeal here, but the pitted fruits, cream, coffee, molasses and especially maple syrup sweetness notes are the strongest on the end, which they should be for the style and for how long this has been aged. Overall, a great beer of course and one that should be sampled if you can get your hands on it (it seems much easier than when I bought this one originally [this is my original bottle, but I have many in my cellar right now] from the store) and especially to buy a couple and age some of them for a longer period of time (in optimal conditions, of course), as I have another bottle from this same purchase that I might have in another 5 or 10 years on a special occasion. Great to sample of course and as a Michigander and as someone who loves real Maple Syrup, this was only fitting to have as my BEER #10,000 and for such a special occasion after aging it for almost six years myself. Great to sample and while I like writing so much for each beer, this one finally ushers in a change for me to simplify my ratings entirely and post much less 'wordie' ratings and verbose typings as I have been doing for my FIRST 10,000!

I especially like how they ignored the bacon temptation--this works so well featuring the original KBS with a worthwhile variation... it's a compliment this urges me to finish and pour a dram of the Jack Daniels Barrel Select I bought a while back, thought that introduces banana--eh, another story for another time... speaking of stories: I had a bomber waiting to be consumed on my forty-second birthday while staying with my in-laws in between houses, and my son unwittingly smashed it while opening the refrigerator...the dog loved it, but we all cried a bit.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"This is for founders CBS “imperial stout with chocolate and coffee aged and maple syrup bourbon barrels.” This is the closest beer I could find so I am putting my review here. Pours almost black. Thin tan head. I was somewhat disappointed in this as I had had the breakfast stout and the KBS and enjoyed both of those. Strong notes of coffee and chocolate. Very lightly hopped. Light to moderate carbonation. A good brew but it was just too sweet for me

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"The aroma is not strong but quite noticeable, complex. First of all, a lot of cocoa and coffee beans, there is a barrel but not much, pleasant chocolate, something between black and Belgian, there are notes of syrup, but a little. The color is black, a little oily in structure, the foam is surprisingly very good, finely bubbled, coffee, but not very persistent. The taste at first is just good and nothing more, also a lot of cocoa beans, again less coffee but more chocolate with vanilla notes. But after the beer has completely warmed up, there are pleasant velvety notes of malt and a barrel that do not give out an iota of alcohol or anything else nasty. The aftertaste is steep and complex, already much more notes of a barrel and sweet caramel notes of bourbon, also almost for the first time the taste of syrup manifests itself, although its sharpness is still a little lacking. Overall a very balanced stout, I realized why this beer is so cool, although is it better than the top pastry stouts? That's a good question.",0.0,0.9698

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Strong...very strong, this Canadian Breakfast Stout, which incorporates chocolate, coffee, maple syrup in its recipe and which is aged in bourbon barrels. Beers with strong aromatic intensities and a strong presence in the mouth require a flawless balance to be successful. And this is the case here with a warm and powerful alcohol, while remaining supple, with a sugar that is very present without being too much, and aromas of coffee, chocolate, bourbon maple syrup with light spices of all beauty. Very good control. In the glass we are on a total black with a fine brown foam. The nose is on coffee and bourbon in dominance with in addition chocolate, maple syrup and light spices. When tasting, it sends from the attack, with a warm and punchy alcohol without being too loaded for a whole that remains refined. Superb second mouth both silky and racy. The aftertaste, where the coffee and bourbon duo is dominant, is punchy with a lot of temperament. The long and sober finale ends the tasting in a very elegant way.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Aroma: the aroma may not kill you but it is very pleasant, heavy, sweet, complex and comprehensive. High-class coffee, chocolate, unbeatable maple syrup, lots of vanilla, I didn't feel the noble notes of bourbon, only vanilla. In addition, raisins and dried fruit, pralines. It smells nice but the barrel itself could be more pronounced.

Appearance: black tarry, quite good, coffee foam, fine bubbles.

Taste: very intense, aggressive, sharp taste, coffee and dark chocolate in the foreground, maple syrup, notes of vanilla and bourbon stronger than in the aroma, plus a lot of woody, rough notes from the barrel. But there is a real invasion of coffee and chocolate on the taste buds here. Very sweet in total, although there is a counter here in the form of bitter coffee and chocolate.

Feel: I drank thicker and fuller, I think the alcohol burns the tongue slightly, smooth, dark chocolate and coffee on the finish.
Overall: very good, sweet, complex and intense beer but in my opinion it does not deserve such a high mark because first of all the body, secondly the barrel, thirdly too sweet. I really prefer to buy e.g. one of the Gates from Maltgarden, in a larger bottle and for less money and I have much greater pleasure from interesting Gates from Maltgarden than from CBS.

The aging process in barrels that had stored both whiskey and syrup makes for one of the most unique flavors ever achieved in a stout.",0.0,0.9336

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"A rather expensive bottle found in Guadeloupe, but what the hey, this thing is hyped and I'm on vacation. Poured slightly chilled it has okay dark beige foam and brownish black body. Smells of deep and heavy maple and coffee, the coffee takes centre stage but the maple helps immensely to tone it down a bit. Some vague wood notes and coffee liqueur is showing. Taste is deep syrupy coffee liqueur in a good way, maple is helping to smooth and balance everything out. Mouthfeel is  smooth and chewy, warming, the alcohol is nowhere to be seen, I'm not sure how it could get better than this. Nonetheless this is very good, heavy but extremely balanced.

Founders CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Well, what else can you say about Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout? It has the highest rating for Founders on RateBeer – 4.30. The sample I tested was Release 2018, without the policeman (for those who don’t know: in 2017, CBS was released in bottles for the first time after a long break – the previous release was in 2011. Previously, the label depicted a Canadian mounted policeman, but the CBS Release 2018 label depicts only a rearing horse – without a rider, the label was changed at the request of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, since this image turned out to be a registered trademark). Of course, I haven’t tried the beer bottled in 2011, but I managed to buy Release 2017 in Italy, it hasn’t been delivered to Russia yet. Compared to 2017, 2018 seemed more balanced and soft to me. Well, CBS itself is undoubtedly a dessert imperial, oily, slightly sticky, with a low creamy foam cap at the beginning, the smell is magnificent, the taste: caramel, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, notes of oak, bourbon, vanilla, of course maple syrup (but without fanaticism). The alcohol is hidden quite well and does not distract attention, but warms in the end. CBS is a full-bodied, complex in taste and aroma imperial, all components in a great balance. In the aftertaste there is a little bitterness and maple syrup at the same time. One minus - the bottle volume of 0.355 is small, a couple more sips are missing :-).",0.050251890762960605,0.9438

Thin, moussy, deep brownish-tinged bead head, opening middle but stable in the form of a ring, over a black beer with deep bronze-ish brown edges. Overwhelming, incredibly rich bouquet of Christmas cake, gingerbread including a lot of soft spicy cinnamon, hot chocolate sauce and chocolate liqueur, nutmeg, vanilla-ish bourbon and oak, fudge, brownies, rum, liquorice, fresh cloves, juniper leaves, 'kruidenkoeken' en 'pepernoten' galore. Sweet onset, brown sugariness thickly coating hints of dates and raisins, noble and very concentrated, soft carbo, very thick and greasy mouthfeel. Profoundly deep 'chocolateness' and toffeeish malt goodness ensues, deeply and elegantly nutty, like a mixture of liquid chocolate bars and liquid gingerbread. This huge and decadently delicious pile of malts is brightened by soft woody tannins, vanilla-ish oak and bourbon colours, all on top of the familiar sweet and almost 'Christmassy' ethereal cinnamon and vanilla bean flavours. The chili heat, like in the regular version, accentuates a warming, obviously very bourbon-like alcohol effect without becoming too obtrusive. This is a majestic, caleidoscopic, awe-inspiring masterpiece of a stout - I had already fallen in love with the regular one, but this one is even better, and exceeds my highest expectations. One of the very best stouts I ever had the honour to taste, regardless of hype; I do not see how any stout can get any better than this so after a moment of doubt and comparing it with other top class stouts I had so far, I have no other choice but to give this perfect beauty a near perfect score...",0.04472135954999579,0.9987

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Pitch black and completely opaque without even a trace of lighter color. Half finger dark mocha head that quickly settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. Nice color but has poor retention. Foam head fades and there’s not much in the way of lacing. 

The nose on this beer is really incredible. Excellent barrel character that doesn’t completely overpower the complex malt bill of the base. Perfectly integrated. A touch of damp oak and subtle toothpick but not too strong of a wood flavor. Really nice spirit with spicy whiskey/boozy bourbon flavor. Barrel also gives off a lot of vanilla bean, toasted coconut and gooey marshmallow. Underneath, there is a very nice blend of roasted and sweet, desert-like malts. Subtle roast but not overpowering with some coffee bean, burnt toast, smoke, oatmeal and bitter dark chocolate. This is countered by silky chocolate-like sweetness, caramel, milk chocolate, lactic cream, fudge and molasses. This beer smells crazy good. 

Full body with oily viscosity and a blast of boozy heat that lingers over the other barrel notes and complex malts into a dry, hot finish. Lots of alcohol flavor and the ABV isnt very well masked. spicy rye whiskey along with dry oak/toothpick. Barrel isn’t as complex as in the nose. Spirit is really strong and it has a stronger wood flavor than I prefer. Some subtle vanilla/coconut sweetness. Malts flavors are still lingering underneath but they are blasted and overwhelmed by the heat/whiskey. Stronger roasted malt presence than expected with burnt sugary sweetness. Deeply roasted robust espresso/coffee flavor along with smoke, burnt wood, charred toast and bitter dark cocoa. As the palate adjusts the sweet fudge/baker’s chocolate notes start to show. Pretty good but isn’t as complex as expected. The chile spiciness and cinnamon show up after it warms but the palate needs to adjust to the overwhelming whiskey and heat. Smells great but it’s really hot and boozy and the malt bill is overly charred/roasted. Decent but kind of underwhelming considering the fanfare.",0.0,0.9955

Perennial Abraxas - Barrel-Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Thanks to Matt and Kevin, shared with my family on Christmas Eve.

Pours a viscous black color, with a small, fluffy, dark brown head, leaving back a perfect, thin lacing at the side of the glass.

Smells of sweetened cinnamon on top of earthy malts, bakers chocolate and a gentle amount of coffee. The Bourbon qualities aren’t too present on their own, but blend very well into the chili spices, adding heat and wood to the nose. Notes of molasses provide a sweetness to the brew, which gets supported by the omnipresent cinnamon spiciness outstandingly well. 

Begins with rich cinnamon flavors straight from the beginning, while earthy, toasted malts, as well as slightly bitter coffee build the foundation of this beer. The cinnamon gets a bit sticky and dusty, while it turns pretty intense on the palate, with molasses and toffee adding a lot of sweetness to its dominant spiciness. The Bourbon barrel, mirroring the nose, doesn’t turn very present on its own, while it interacts perfectly well with the chilies, leaving the spicy cinnamon with an interesting, hot and complex touch on the palate. The sweetness gets balanced by a wooden Bourbon bite, which got a semi dry, bitter aspect to it, highlighting the earthy malts. 

Finishes with a sublte, spicy burn, while coffee becomes more present, still with a slick sweetness detectable, which is now calmed by the wooden maltiness, while the Bourbon shines through in its wooden, vanilla qualities, with a peppery bite. Has an incredible smooth mouthfeel, with a hot burn in the end. The beers body is incredible full and quite different to the normal version, while providing less coffee, way more cinnamon and the proper sweetness.",0.042107596053325945,0.9964

Aroma: Wonderful dark chocolate with a little cinnamon and chili heat.

Appearance: So dark. So very dark. Very little head/retention.

Taste: Wow. This is like drinking dark chocolate, with a light cinnamon burn and chili pepper heat at the finish. A little whiskey on the back end as well, not nearly as assertive as I expected.

Palate: Very light carbonation, big, heavy body, but easy to drink for the size and minimal alcohol noticeable.

Tasted on 8/2/14 with the Savages from a 750mL bottle, huge thanks to peteypie for sharing this one! Pours completely black with a thin brown head that slowly recedes, leaving a thin collar. The nose is really quite amazing with tons of cinnamon, coconut, dark chocolate, coffee, sweeter milk chocolate, and just a touch of chili pepper burn on the nostrils. The flavor is more focused on the bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and cinnamon, with all of the coconut and vanilla oak notes underlying, and some chili pepper heat starting to peak through on the back of the palate. The body is full with just a bit more carbonation than I like on a beer this big, and a long bitter dark chocolate, coffee, light vanilla, and chili pepper heat finish.",0.0,0.8526

A - Pours black with a nice one and a half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small trails of lace down the sides of the glass.




S - Smells of warm bourbon, strong chili heat, room temperature chocolate, vanilla beans, fresh ground cinnamon and a bit of light booze. Was really hard to finish my glass because it smelled so incredible.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Well, here we are then: one of the biggest whales from Belgium, the legendary start of Dolle's Special Reserva editions and therefore the very first beer in Belgium to have been deliberately aged on wooden casks which previously contained another beverage, red Bordeaux wine in this case. The pioneering role of Dolle Brouwers cannot be underestimated, in being the first non-family-owned craft brewery in Belgium (around 1980, the same time as the beginnings of Abbaye des Rocs' brewing activities); then in 2000, this Special Reserva series, which is continued to this day and has been applied not only to Stille Nacht but also to Oerbier and on one occasion to Dulle Teve (of which a new one is in the process of preproduction now), marks the beginning, at least in Belgium, of what is now common practice among craft breweries around the world. The brewer, Kris, was generous enough to offer us a vertical tasting of all Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions yesterday and needless to say, I cannot thank him enough for his kind generosity - I did have a few Stille Nacht Special Reserva editions before, but never this legend, the ultimate one, a whale I never thought I would ever be able to taste. Carefully opened by Kris himself, the 17 year-old 75 cl bottle, with rusty crown cap and charmingly moldy and partially disintegrated label, did effectively - and contrary to my expectations - produce a minimal head upon pouring, in the form of a thin ring of eggshell-white, loosely knit bubbles, which expectedly disappeared shortly thereafter; the beer itself was of a most beautiful and intense, almost glowing orange-amber colour with a molten copper-like hue, clear initially but hazy with sediment near the finishing of the bottle. A milky cloud of dead yeast and proteins appeared only in the very end. The aroma was of an unbelievable complexity, depth and beauty - I cannot recall ever having sniffed any barleywine (because that is basically, though perhaps unintentionally, what were are talking about here) that comes close to this: gooseberry jam, candied orange peel and marmelade, beguiling vanilla-ish wet oak wood, sweet white dessert wine, honey liqueur, armagnac, matured sweet sherry, old cider, amaretto, marzipan, fresh fig juice, moist raisin bread and, as a sign of its respectable age, hints of wet cardboard and damp cellar, only adding charm, maturity and complexity. The onset was sweet, lush and almost 'praline'-like, hinting at candied figs, sugared fried apples and sweet raspberry jam, drenched in an orangey marmelade sauce with a light sourish sherry hint, that stretches towards the finish where it becomes more outspoken - though a kaleidoscopic, utterly refined and ravishingly beautiful candied sweetness remains the main flavour. Carbonation is evidently very soft (but not at all flat!), resulting in a thick, very vinous, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Thick layers of caramelly and slightly cookie-like malt sweetness with honey and marmelade sweetness on top blend with an unbelievably deep and rich finish, where sweet dessert wine flavours (rather than actual Bordeaux, strangely) are added, tannic woodiness renders a gently drying effect and very sherry-like oxidation, of the noblest kind I may ever have encountered in any vintage beer, establishes a deeply elegant and luscious maturity. Vanilla-, marmelade-, marzipan- and cognac-like impressions make this almost like a liquid crêpe Suzette - with yeasty breadiness added in the very end, soaked in brandy-like alcohol warmth. This is, along with some of the greatest lambics, the most impressive Belgian beer I ever tasted - I feel humbled by this, and not just because of its legendary status in the craft beer world. It is hard to describe, even for me, how beautiful, opulent, deep and aristocratic this beer is; this is without any doubt at the very top of what beer can do in a gastronomical sense, so I cannot but give this the perfect score - if this doesn't deserve that, then I don't know what does. What makes it all the more remarkable, is that it has remained in such mint condition after seventeen years - this only adds to the fact that this product was made and cared for with utmost knowledge, skill and experience. My deepest gratitude goes out to Kris, not only for being so immensely generous to offer this and other bottles for our tasting session, but for giving a beer as utterly beautiful as this to the world. A whole string of young craft breweries today, in Belgium but also on an international level, can and should learn from this. A day to never forget!",0.026822089039291,0.9996

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"10th September 2011
Cloudy orange - brown beer. Decent sized white head. Nose reminds me very much of a Vintage Port cork that has just been pulled. Palate is soft and semi dry and quite well carbonated. Mild caramel malt backbone, tasting slightly aged. Riding over all this are rich wine notes. Red wine with strawberry and then later on blackberry and blackcurrant. Agitating the beer produces some lactose on the nose. Aniseed becomes more obvious. There is a surprising amount of carbonation here and much agitation is required to remove it! The finish is dry and woody. This is the most Port like beer I’ve ever had. Even the Port barrel beers have not been this porty. If you look at recent ratings people are saying this is past it’s best. Who knows but judging it on it’s own merit it’s still quite remarkable it it’s uniqueness and rich flavour. The alcohol is still quite robust. The most surprising thing about this is that De Dolle have never redone this. 2013 postscript - they must have read my mind!

Some specific details about this beer that will affect my rating points on this

This beer was held in a colling room at constant temperature for the past 12 years, i’m mearly stating this because i was sceptic about keeping beer chilled all those years and i thought it would kill some of the flavours.

This beer has proved me wrong, as most raters tend to say the beer had gone sour i can’t do anything but saying this beer wasn’t sour at all and has held up superbly !!! 


Head: bottle fizzed ( not gushing just making a sound ) and carbonation was still pretty damn good, white but very thin had that gets out of the way after a couple of minutes 

Colour: totally clear , golden/amberish 

Smell: sweet malts, touch of honey, ever so slight booze that blends perfectly  with the other scents, touch of dairy 

Taste: texture is thick and sweet just like a fine high quality Sauternes !!, superb flavours that are impossible to describe, i don’t know what the beer tsted like fresh, but it’s probabbly pretty close but mellowed to what it actually was, i have never ever had a aged beer that was so balanced, smooth, lively and perfect after 12 ( and even less ) years of aging !.

I never give beers a 5-star rating because i think the perfect beer doesn’t exist, but i’ve been proven wrong , this beer is perfect in my eyes, and if i would be able to trade my cellar for this beer i would do it without a doubt !!!

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"750mL Bottle, poured at the B. United table of Beervana - Cranston, RI. Thanks to Matthias for opening this gem. I can’t believe I actually got to try this beer. I had to wait in line for a long time, but it happened. I think the age makes this a bit anticlimatic, as the nose opens with a fair dose of oxidation, despite persistent carbonation and a solid cork. Interestingly, the wet apple note that comes with the oxidation seems to bolster the Calvados-like nature of this beer. The warm, spiced fruit and cooked apple characters of this beer persist and the heat continues to show. Sparklingly dry. A treat for sure, but past its prime.",0.0,0.959

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Most graciously shared by EDA, jez I never thought this would come around.  I was as awed as the rest.  I got one of the early pours from the bottle and then a little from the end to have a nice mix in the glass. Either way the first pour was still pretty murky, could not see through it but it definitely was a glowing golden color. It poured with a small head but it stuck around. Aroma is definitely aged, lots of aged malts that have turned into slightly cardboard but very sweet honey malts. And a cool yet weird moldy/sour old white grape.  Lots of damp basement in the aroma as well. Taste is similar with less of the basement aspect but still plenty sweet.  The ’basement’ maybe the oak. The yeastiness also really breaks through with lots of doughiness. As far as aged beer goes this is held up very well and is very nice to try, again as far as aged beer goes.  So I will rate it as a good ’old beer.’  Thanks again Mike. 750mL bottle, white wine glass.",0.0,0.99

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"750mL bottle, courtesy of mwsf, shared trade with acrdz and I.  Goddamn.  Thanks so much, Matt!  Pours a lightly hazy, orange-brown color; honey-yellow edges; good amount of viscosity; solid perimeter of off-white bubbles with patchy lacing.  Loads of honey in the aroma: vinous red fruits, Belgian sugar, cherries coupled with the slightest tartness; some chewy caramel from oxidation, but this doesn’t overwhelm the other, clearer notes; incredibly dense, honey-laden, vinous nose; no show of the alcohol underneath.  Full mouthfeel: similar honey-like sweetness and viscosity that one would expect from the stille nacht, but coupled with lightly tannic red fruits, incredibly complex yeastiness, chewy caramel, and viscous Belgian sugars; this bottle seems to have held up beautifully (thanks to great cellaring, evidently, and large pours); there’s nothing thin about this beer, nothing close to watery or relaxed concentration; I could sip this for effectively forever, and I just might.  Lengthy finish: sweet, complex honey and yeastiness, toasty breadiness, and a touch of red fruits, spicing, and dough.

 The aroma was just exquisite.. definitely a solid dose of Bordeaux influence over a sweet, supple base.. the underlying beer mellowed out considerably, leaving sweet caramel, toffee, and a delicate bouquet of light fruits (peaches, apricots, and some vinous influence).. deeper oak and Bordeaux undertones as well.. almost a sweet bourbon in there too. 

 The flavor begain with an array of sweet lighter fruits, sour oak, and grape skins, followed by warm caramel and toffee on the middle (accented by warm clove and other Christmas-ey spices).. warm back-end with a touch of oak and a bunch more vinous.. very long, warm, sweet and complex finish.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,This generously provided bottled brew from Mike Sprinkle on Dark Lord Day poured a head of frothy fine to medium sized bubbles that were mostly diminishing and left behind a hazy uncarbonated orange brown colored body. The strong aroma was spicy and malt hop. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish. The complex yummy flavor contained notes of mild spice and malt hop. Delicious and one I would certainly like to drink again but will probably never get trhe chance to sample this sought after brew again.,0.0,0.8355

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Big thanks to Mike for bringing this to DLD--a very generous gesture for certain.  The pour was a nice, slightly hazy golden color.  Small head.  The aroma is lively, with tons going on--green grapes, sour apples, light caramel, honey, light brown sugar and light breadiness.  The flavor matches, with more malt to balance out perfectly the sour tastes and the light fruit flavors.  12% shows up nowhere in the flavor at this point.

Smell is of hearty caramel, brown sugar, raisins, biscuits, vanilla, definite traces of wine, Belgain yeast, along with sugary bread. Small amounts of apples & cinnamon smothered in honey come through with a swirl and an inhale.

Honey, icing from an oreo ice cream cake, spicy relleno and pear/apricot jellies. Also lingering tastes of bread, anise, molasses, candy sugar. Sourness is as pleasant as I’ve found in an aged Belgian. Finish is absolutely monstrous, ten miles long, holding my palate hostage without a ransom in sight.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"750ml - one of only 1920 bottles produced and aged in Saint Julien Bordeaux casks, thereafter bottled in 2002.  Heady aroma fills the nose with a rich, sugary, honeyish malt sweetness, various tangy, tropical and citrus fruits including pineapple, white grape, orange and juicy green apple, along with some earthy, lightly dusty, woody and herbal tones, dried flowers, a slightly musty and estery yeast presence and a certain peppery alcoholic spiciness, all atop a lightly vinous backdrop that does give betray some notion of the aging vessel and the impetus behind the idea.  Gorgeous deep rosy amber color, slightly hazy, with coppery highlights and a lasting, fine, creamy head accompanied by some fairly intricate lacing.  Flavor profile is equally complex and satisfyingly powerful, with suggestions of candied pears, golden raisin and apricot jam, followed by a light amount of spicy bitterness and warming alcohol, finishing with a degree of drying acidity, a blend of peppery spices and some lingering, fairly strong winey touches here and there.  Silky smooth and lightly sticky on the palate with a hugely full body to support the gratifying palette of flavors found here.  Many thanks to Murph who supplied me with this particular bottle back in the summer of 2003. This has been cellared since that time and of course, had been annually in danger of being consumed, however after tasting it certainly seems able to endure a far longer slumber.",0.057353933467640436,0.9747

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours an elegant golden amber with a subtle fire tinge and an even layer of white head.  This beer has everything going on in the aroma - light fruits, dark fruits, spice, vinous character, it just goes on and on.  The first thing to grab my attention are the succulent figs and prunes that decorate the bouquet.  Thoughts of a fine barleywine float through my head before fleeting, being replaced with a distinctly Belgian layer of cinnimony yeasty spice.  Soft, ripened pears and sugary muscat grapes also float gently to my nose, blending artistically with the dark fruity spice.  Rich, full body - lightly syrupy, but at the same time well carbonated mouthfeel.  This is a big beer that hasn’t lost any balance or succumbed to the effects of age.  More fruits flood my tongue.  I continue to be amazed how hoards of figs, prunes, raisins, peaches, apricots, caramel, and spice can coexist together so beautifully.  Each taste is savored carefully, revealing more new fruit sensations before culminating in a subtly woody, majestic finish.

 Poured a hazy rusty orange hued body and a kakhi brown head. The aroma radiated a cornucopia of fruit; apples, sweet red & tart green, plums and pears. Amass of beet sugars on the front of the flavor profile, followed by oak, vinilla and a suggestion of apple cider. There was a bit of sourness, mostly from the cask aging, the oxidation was minimal for a 6 year old beer. Overall, as exceptional as this beer truly was, it was too sweet, which helped hide the bold Alc, yet it was still phenolic and aggressive; and although Truly toned down from the original yearly release of Stille Nacht, this baby was still a monster… even with 6 years of life behind it.",0.0,0.9678
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Happily shared at Choice City in Fort Collins. Beer poured a medium, hazy caramel brown without a head to really speak of. The first impression on the nose: sweet, warm, caramel apple lovies on toast, yet so much more. One of a handfull of beers I’ve ever had that create a transcendant experience of beauty. The kind where the sum of the parts combine to create a divine whole that overwhelms and makes the world fall away with the sound of a down comforter being dropped to the ground. The aroma was malty with moderate toasted grain, heavy, warm, sticky, drippy caramel, moderate-to-heavy cookie notes; Hoppy with mellow moderate herb note, trace note of resin and pine and a light note of lemon zest; Yeasty with moderate funky notes of attic and cellar, light cookie doughiness; Moderate-to-heavy green apple peel and simmered apple, vanilla-heavy oak,moderate warm, spicy alcohol, lightly vinous on the back of a deep inhale. The flavor was heavily sweet (not sticky or cloying in the least), lightly to moderately acidic, warm and  lightly bitter. The finish was warm, moderately sweet, lightly bitter. ABV cloaked in the sweet, warm folds. The body was full, the texture was velvety/syrupy and the carbonation was soft.  Thanks for sharing this BeerandBlues2, Mrs. BeerandBlues2 and Ernest.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Produced in 2000, Stille Natch Reserva is a very special, limited addition of De Dolle’s seasonal Christmas brew, Stille Nacht or ""Silent Night."" Stille Natch is a very special beer to begin with, but De Dolle really out did themselves when they decided to do Reserva. Stille Nacht is brewed with with pale malts, white candy sugar, is hopped, and then dry hopped with Nugget hop varieties, and comes in at a warming 9-10% abv. De Dolle boils this beer for 5 hours, making it a very high gravity brew. It is then bottle conditioned, and will continue to develop in the bottle. 

Any vintage of Stille Nacht is a true gift to any beer lover, but a 750ml corked bottle of the Reserva is truly a Christmas treasure. Reserva takes it to a whole new realm. Reserva was produced in 2000, and was aged for 18 months in Bordeaux wine barrels before being bottled. This age in the wine barrels, gives an already incredible beer a level of complexity, flavor, and character, that is in a class by itself. Reserva comes in at a warming 12% abv, making a very potent beer as well. 


Stille Nacht Reserva pours to a beautiful, hazy, deep golden color with a thick and creamy pillow of a head, and a lively and vibrant carbonation. The nose on this beer is incredibly complex and aromatic with big robust aromas just bursting in the air. Aromas of sweet malt, oak, candy sugar, deep vinous notes, spicy hops, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The plate on this beer is rich and full, yet at the same time, has a nice bit of acidity, that dances on the tongue. Big, robust flavors of sweet malt, light caramel, oak, pepper, black berry, and vinous flavors, coat the tongue and glide down the palate. It is almost too much of a good thing, as your taste buds will be on bliss over load. Reserva finishes with more complex flavors up front, then ends with very vinous, acidic, and peppery flavors that linger on the tongue for quite sometime. 

In a word, this beer is stunning. This beer was one of the most enjoyable beers I have drank, ever. The age in the Bordeaux barrels really give this beer a whole new dimension. The vinous qualities of this beer combined with the fantasic malty overtones and warming alcohol makes this one of the most delicous beers ever produced in my opinion.",0.030400895015524076,0.9979

Nose was scotch, and wood and caramel and then the overwhelming aroma of a fine port wine. The taste was of port, but different.

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"750ml. bottle that was oh so graciously shared by Willblake. Probably the one beer I’ve wanted to try more than any other. Golden/orange color with  a small white head. Greatest aroma I’ve ever encountered in any kind of beverage.
Smells like a beautifully aged port wine
with lots of oak, vanilla, caramel and much more than I can describe. Taste again reminds me of a great port, with an incredibly silky smooth texture. Sweet, but never cloying. I sort of wish I never tried this because I know I’ll never have it again and might never taste anything so delicious in my life. Thanks again Jon!",0.0,0.981

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"i almost fell out of my chair when willblake opened this up at the jimmack04 invitational, having basically given up on ever having it.  every bit of expectation was met and exceeded as soon as the first whiff  of it hit my nose...tones of smokey wood, sweet red wine, hints of scotch, vanilla, caramel and spices assaulted my senses.  i spent about 5 minutes just smelling my glass, which contained a copper elixr with a full white head, a surprising amount of carbonation considering the bottle was a 2000 vintage.  when i finally got around to taking my first sip, my tastebuds suffered the same explosion of sensations that my nose was trying to recover from...flavors of sweet red wine, corriander, vanilla and caramel malts blended together perfectly, none taking more of a role than any other.  a perfectly smooth, velvety mouthfeel gives way to a slightly warm sensation as each sip goes down finishes an unbelievable experience.  my thanks to jon cannot be quantified.",0.0,0.935
De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"05.22.05  750 shared at jimmack04 invitational.  The third time I’ve had this brew and each time is better than the first.  This beer, each time I enjoy it, produces another one of those magical beer moments where it’s almost impossible to pick up the pen to write any notes.  The first two times I’ve had it, I didn’t even bother, this time I knocked off at least something to make it official...This beer is a 30 year old wood aged port in disguise.  In fact, nothing from Bordeaux has ever come close to what De Dolle managed to extract from this wood.  Honey colored and wonderfully viscous with an unfortunately sudsy, sort of soapy head, but at least it still shows some carbonation despite its age and size.  Color and clarity are gorgeous.  The body is pure silk.  Forget every other time I said a brew had a velvet or silken palate.  I was an idiot.  This brew glides on Apollo’s wings across the palate, pure love.  The flavor embodies all that is ancient wooded port, hints of sherry, dry spices.  It’s a Christmas vigil with the fireworks of the 4th of July.  It’s sweet, savory, and deep, while its still making a sweet case for attention.  Hell, it’s too good to deal with the pen in my hands; it takes two hands to control this snifter.",0.0,0.9571

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Bottle at the 4/17/2005 Montreal tasting, shared with Rastacouere, Muzzlehatch, Tiggmtl, MartinT, Beerbuzzmontreal, Olivier and Simon.  Sipped while cooincidentally listening to the Beatles’ ""I want you"".  Aroma bursts forth from the bottle a full, intense and divine creation of sensory stimulants.  So good, the bottle was passed around and people waited in line to get ""seconds"" of smelling the bottle.  I described the aroma as ""just pure goodness"" but I will try to elaborate on that.  Fully rounded, never sharp notes of soft oak woodiness, red berries, soft grapes, caramel, toffee, sweet cherries, marzipan, maple, vanilla, subtle yet strong Belgian yeast, touches of light dough/honey and a bit of drying tannins for balance.  Wow.  Appearance is a thick-looking vibrant auburn-copper-amber color, with lacing as the small white head quickly recedes (no doubt 5 years in the cellar, oak aging, and a high alcohol).  Can the flavor live up to the aroma? It’s possible, I dare to think.  And to some extent, it does.  The flavor of a beer, in my mind, is a much more difficult beast to control and perfect, having to meld balance, mouthfeel and actual taste altogether perfectly.  Perhaps I am just an easier judge of aroma, but it seems easier to imagine a perfect aroma than a perfect flavor.  That being said, there was a little less intensity to the flavor than the aroma, some very light oxidation, a touch of dryness where it dosent belong and maybe a slight receding of firm, thick maltiness.  But this is criticism the beer brings upon itself.  I think near-perfect beers are easier to find faults with, being so close to perfect.  It is easy to hold them to a higher level, created by their sheer magnificence.  The malt is nonetheless, thick, rich, creamy and filling.  Candied apples, soft notes of smoked cinnamon, vanilla, syrupy cherry liqueur of the finest variety.  Bits of dry barley, light maple, playful Bordeaux wine fruitiness and light oak, never overdone, on the finish.  Distinct Belgian nuances from the yeast, light raisins, dates, plums and delicate brown sugar.  Perfect mouthfeel, full and not thin ever, but yet so easily drinkable for me.  Alcohol gives some warmth as it goes down, but does not show anywhere near 12%.  A most treasured experience, drinking this beer, and hopefully, with some luck, one I will have again.  Score is very difficult to give on this as far as flavor and overall,  I could easily justify a perfect score, especially taking in to account the graceful way this has aged.  But I will discount the flavor a point, and see what I think next time I have it.",0.03406013516450858,0.9988

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"Bottle-conditioned, obtained thanks to my newest great buddy sprinkle (the holy grail! Finally!): cloudy dark orangey amber. Minimal lacing on disappearing head. Woah that nose! This has to be one of the best smells ever. Extremely vinous and potent. The Bordeaux wood really comes through, basking its glory into an already capable beer. I’ll sound like I’m just enumerating, but this is an equilibrium, trust me, everything at the right place and everything does include a lot of things! Sharp cookie dough flavours, cinnamon powder, vanilla, maple, barley sugar, bananas, oranges, pancakes, nutmeg, pears, nuts.. lots and lots of flavours. Complexity layer over complexity layer. It somehow manages to remain diplomatic, begs to be sipped while forcing you to take your time through pure transcendence and force. WOAH! Yeast overload in mouth, this is more than doughy, it’s a pure French toast. Vinous dates, sweet desserty liquor, a big liquid cake. I’ve no idea how so many flavours can be balanced, no idea. It’s almost a case of name as many flavours as you can and have fun finding them in here. Magnetic sheer polar extremes. Velvet mouthfeel, silky full body, soft carbonation, venerable in that aspect. Evolving flavors, complex, elegant, what more do you want? Decadent stuff. If a beer has ever lived up to the hype, this is it, I’d dare even find it underrated as a matter of fact ;-) That this was possibly not the best bottle of this tasting I consider as the best I’ve been part of is an indication of how good my dreams will be in the next few days.",0.0,0.9931

De Dolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000🇧🇪Belgian Ale - Strong Pale,"2000 Bottle... This beer rocks!... Sparkling clear golden brew. Medium-sized creamy white head. After only a couple minutes, only a swirl of head and plenty of lacework remains.
The nose holds heavy notes of tawny port, maple syrup, French oak and light sourgham molasses. Lesser notes of anise, yeasty bread dough, banana, alcohol and plums.
The flavor is of tawny port, molasses, candy sugar, apricot and other things excellent. Clover honey along with an astringent, lightly bitter and acetic hop presence on the backside. Also, plenty of warm alcohol.
Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Long, lightly tart, astringent, dry finish.

Of 87 belgian beers to choose from..what shall i choose? I turn to my compatriots for assistance..Dasilky, jcalabre, 21iceman40...and DeDolle Stille Nacht Reserva 2000 is the resounding answer...thus it was and thus the bottle was cracked for all ratebeerians alike!!! The aroma was the goddamn funkiest amalgamation i had smelled in a while. The first whiff i took which was more of a passing sniffer got pancake syrup. Seriously...blueberry pancake syrup!!! A more proliferated whiff picked up apples, oranges, blueberry, doughiness, and still syrup with a minor alcoholic presence. The taste does make some attempt to hide that 12% ABV which is JUST MASSIVE but in the end nothing can be done to hide the monster beneath. Some definite brandy-like qualities here. I like the orangey citrus aspects, a nice oak quality as well..it almost possesses the aged idea and by osmosis it gets transferred over to your taste buds. Very tummy warming and dry as hell given that whopping 12% alcohol content.

Soft and sweet carmelized fruits (apples, maybe pears and grapes notably with others i cant even describe) show up first followed by a mild blast of oaky tartness/woodiness that makes for an unbelievable interplay.

AleSmith Speedway Stout - Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Coffee🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Tap at AleSmith Brewery Tap Room

Aroma: well rounded roasted aroma, caramel, coffee. But this beer really have a great balanced flavor. The coffee, malt and bourbon scents are all there and very distinct. High definition, and great smell. Usually, a stout will have multiple levels of smells and they would be blended together, but this stout have all scents and they are very easy to pick out. And it's the authentic coffee, authentic roasty smell. 4.6/5

Appearance: At a certain stage when everything is correct, I look for the corners. This beer hits all the marks, and what I have to say is the lace. Truly beautiful. Great lace retention. 4.6/5

Flavor: again, very similar to the aroma, this beer is great on all flavors, and the barrel aging just make all the flavors more balanced and all rounded. I can clearly take the bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, malt. I would say this is indeed THE BEST STOUT I have tried so far. 4.75/5

Mouthfeel: smooth, thick, full body, but with all the good sides on bourbon. 4.5/5

Overall: The reason why I love this beer is because it just brings all the designed flavors in a very great way. Since they have another blue mountain coffee stout version, and this Vietnamese coffee is just a bit better. I don't wanna give it a 10/10 since you never know if there are more good stuff outta there. 18/20.",0.0,0.9982

I didn't expect that this day would come so quickly and that I would reach this level quite quickly.
Heck! I don't even intend to back down and I continue in search of the so-called beer whalez. 
There are really few of them left (of course I'm talking about those not checked off in the Top50 RB ;). Some will be extremely hard to get, but I believe that one day I will manage to fill the ranking to, say, the 45/50 level. 
Cheers! 🍻

Alcohol: 12% vol.

Version: 2016

Color: Black as the devil's eyes. Complete lack of transparency.

Foam: Difficult to identify, because after uncapping, strong gushing appeared. Beige color and structure consisting of small, beige eyes. 

It quickly shrank to a ring, leaving pretty discs on the walls. 

Smell: An unforgettable, omnipresent aroma. 

There are many layers of initiation here. 

The bourbon barrel brings an intense scent of chocolate, cuckoo candies, vanilla and burnt caramel. 
It is closely followed by aromatic, strongly roasted coffee. 

The accents of cream ice cream, cocoa, marzipan and wet oak also keep pace. In the final stretch, cane sugar and molasses reach. 

The smell is arranged in individual layers and opens up over time like a flower. 

Taste: On the tongue, smooth, silky from the first sip. 
Milk chocolate, cocoa, almond nuts, Nutella and burnt caramel melt in the mouth. The coffee has a sweet profile and a moderate degree of roasted notes. 
The sweetness of coconut wafers, oak wood and barrel vanilla fills and caresses the palate.
The aftertaste of Kopiko and Kukułki candies filled with crunchy caramel and chocolate lingers in the mouth for a long time. Although the beer has a high fullness and is extremely full and substantial, it is characterized by a rather distinct roasted finish.
The texture, as I mentioned earlier, is as thick as engine oil.
The concealment of alcohol content - masterful.

Pure joy! A shot worth its hype!

Saturation: Low.

Summary:

BBVSS seduces with its taste and overwhelms with its aroma.
It conceals a wealth of various flavor and aroma notes.

The barrel profile is unforgettable, although the coffee is not as essential as I expected.

Balance and multi-layeredness are the two most important features of this drink.

Probably AleSmith's best beer and 100% the best from the Speedway Stout series.",0.0,0.9947

This was pretty much my most sought after beer. Absolutely loved the regular Vietnamese Coffee version (4.53) and expect this one to be the best beer I ever tried. That good. Was lucky enough to get a free pour while going to Emily’s birthday party. A huge thanks to Chris and Lesley for probably a huge tab. Rushed this, but here’s to heaven.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head when I got it. Very serene setting underneath the chaos. Excellent spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled smooth buttery bourbon, milk chocolate syrup, cocoa, some malt chocolate, creamy espresso, vanilla, toffee and sweet caramel. (Smell - 4.75)

Wow on the taste. Still than milky chocolate syrup, malt chocolate, smooth bourbon, creamy vanilla, touch of oak, espresso, lactose and coffee creamer. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Just as awesome as I hoped it would be. So glad I got the chance to have it. Unfortunately I feel like I slightly overrated it a tad. (Overall - 4.75)

There is a strong barrel character as well. The bourbon is big and it does offer a nice addition of vanilla. The coffee is quite subdued, which I’m not that much of a fan of.

There is a strong woodiness to it that I just don’t care too much for. The head and chocolate balance well though. The mouth feel is a little light.

>>> AleSmith strikes again with a wonderfully rich and balanced coffee imperial stout. The mouthfeel is out of this world. 



+  Like most Speedway variants, the beer is beautiful. Pitch black with a medium beige-brown head, very good retention and some lacing 

+  Flavors of coffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon and even marshmallow are all very intense and deep, but at the same time they are totally cohesive and nothing is overpowering 

+  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, super silky and rich with a mild alcohol warmth at the end 

+  It’s on par with the best Speedway variants along the regular, the non barrel-aged Vietnamese one and the bourbon barrel-aged Speedway.

Full of fudge and ground coffee on the nose with lots of dough cream and a warming barrel appearance. Coffee is extremely well pronounced, revealing a flowery berry quality, gently wrapped up into fudge and charred malts. 

Drinks outstandingly smooth, very soft on the tongue with an intense barrel infusion, creating a hot bite during the finish, together with bitter coffee.

Tastes of sweeter fudge, immediately coated up by earthy, silk coffee with a faint berry quality to it. This foundation gets joined by a prominent, vanilla heavy, warming barrel, adding smoky oak, camp fire warmth, resin and a whiff of hazelnuts to the taste. Finishes with present, hot, dry bourbon among cream, coated by coffee and fudgy booze.

Full bodied, viscous feel, light warming alcohol in the close, never gets too hot.
Solid BA impy, the bourbon has taken quite a foothold though, will be good to revisit in a year or so when it has mellowed.

>> Three different samples over a two day period. Flatter ink black pour with wispy yellow lacing. Nose is more in the Creme Brulée vein than the Creme Brulée version of Speedway on tap today. But the main character in the nose after it warms is almost pure rum raisin. Taste is a bit sweet and almost all bourbon barrel forward with big rum raisin, flashes of soy. If you like the nuanced flavors of the Vietnamese coffee, they are gone, taken over by the barrel. I honestly don’t see the point of this beer as it kills off what makes the Vietnamese version so good. Rich bitter chocolate? Gone. Balanced hoppiness? Gone. Vietnamese Coffee flavor? Gone.

The pour is a beautiful light orange-tinted golden yellow color with a thicker white head and a couple spots of lace as it falls down to a thin ring. The aroma is spectacular. There is a huge win aspect to it with a light citrus and a ton of stone fruit. I have no idea how this complexity comes, since this is a non-fruited saison. Oh my goodness. The flavor is equally spectacular. The fruitiness, the delicate wheat and light oak, a hint of spice to let you know it’s still a saison.

Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"The one and only Batch 1, 750mL bottle, drunk 1/19/17 at the brewery.
Light-to-minimal haze in this bronze-golden body with fiery copper hues. Well-carbonated, with a big, off-white head that steadily recedes to cover.
The nose strikes me with two things immediately: one, the tell-tale Hill Farmstead ""micro flora"", if you will, creating light acidity, strong minerality and dry, yellow fruits. And two, LOTS of buckwheat character, giving it an almost vegetal funk (very hard to describe). It’s extremely unique and interesting. Beyond that, light black pepper enters the mix alongside light lemon and soft Brett notes. Over the course of 45 minutes, it really softens and turns quite elegant and incredibly funky, neither becoming too acidic nor fruity. No alcohol nor flaw.
In the mouth it’s still tightly carbonated, though the levels seem much lower now and it adds a bit to the drinkability, leaving a bit of wateriness on the end. Dry, of course, with cereal-like character from the buckwheat adding almost a vegetal, corn, vanilla-like note which is snapped up by light brett and lactic acids. Tart and crisp on the finish with soft black pepper and a touch of oaky tannin.
Pretty god damned nice stuff; flavorful, even rich and intense at times yet with a drinkable, simple elegance, as well.",0.054232614454664034,0.9593

Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"[ Bottle ][ 1/3 of 75cl ][ Tasting ][ ][ Tulip ][ 11.29.14 ]
Hazy gold glow, large bubbled white head drops but lasts, lacing along whole glass. Phenols stronger than Flora, light egg alongside tons of dusty hay, cobweb with lasting dough. Citrus front palate, zesty with lightly peppery esters. Mid is thin, carbonation barely supports lemon and dough, thin stinging finish, zesty with more pepper, high carbonation. Pleasant and balanced, low complexity but very integrated.

Surprisingly sour, this funky farmhouse brew also seduces through lean and bubbly mouthfeel, able to polish inherent rusticity to appreciable levels.



Further Personal Perceptions:

-A slice of foam covers the misty blond.

-I hadn’t expected this pungent a sourness.

-This is easily the most intense Blaugies brew I’ve had.

-Straw flavors are quite important as well.

Hill Farmstead / Blaugies Le Sarrasin🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Grabbed this bottle 2 weeks ago, $30 @ 2 per person, quite steep but when you compare it to the $20 375ML younger wild ales from so many breweries, it’s not a bad price. This is effectively a french wine barrel aged saison brewed using organic ingredients and spent up to 6 months bottle conditioning. Just my personal thoughts about the price. Anyway, this sat in my fridge for the 2 weeks since purchase and enjoyed 3 ways



A -  Gorgeous orange gold slight hazziness. 1 finger head fades to a thin line. Slightly sticky lacing. 



S - Nose is a huge wine bursting tart with a mild acidity of fresh oranges. Lots of citrus tart lovely I mean this nose is incredible. 



T -  Taste is challenging to describe. Super bright juicy ripe fruit, super tart and lively hearty but extremely well balanced between a wheat, light bitterness and lemon with an oaky vinous texture.



M - A mouthfeel that is thick and full of bubbly sparkling wine and the tartness resembled raspberry and honey. I don’t know what buckwheat tastes like but I would imagine the minor haze and chewy effervescent is due to that.



O - This s super drinkable! Really delicious and I’m glad I have a few of these to enjoy over the next year or so! Great work Blaugies and Hill Farmstead.",0.0,0.9981

Schramm's The Statement Reserve🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"Bottle (375 ml). 2½ oz pour + 1 oz the day after opening the bottle. Thanks to Matt for the bottle!



Appearance: Deep purple with really nice legs. 



Aroma: A good amount of alcohol at first, but it then settle down as it breathe. Vibrant fresh tart cherries presence with some spiciness, herbal notes and honeyed sweetness. 



Taste: Sweet, but almost perfectly balanced by the acidity and the tartness of the cherries. Here again the cherries are fresh and vibrants. Light to moderate spiciness, honey, a bit boozy and some herbal presence. 



Palate: Medium to full body. Syrupy. Dryer than expected with a nice warming finish from the alcohol and the light spices. Despite being somewhat dry, there’s still some lingering sweetness too (not cloying). 



Overall: This is a damn fine drink! A perfect sipper, except for the fact that it’s too drinkable. It’s probably nearly impossible to do a better job at showcasing the Schaarbeek cherries. Complex, warming and so tasty! The only ""bad"" thing I can say about this one is that, for the price, it’s certainly not 3-4 x better than Black Agnes (in fact I would say that Black Agnes is almost as good if not as good). Now I can’t wait to try Heart of Darkness.

This makes for a very enjoyable coffee stout with distinct, but not overdone chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes, while I suspect that a lot of the chocolate and dark fruit comes from the coffee as well as the malts. At the same time, there's a very good roasted and bitter presence to this as well, with some roasted malts and herbal hops, which is just the kind of flavor profile that I'm looking for from a beer like this. It's very well-balanced, with some lightly sweet notes from the dark fruit and caramel malt, as well as more roasted malt and bitter, herbal hops, as well as hints of licorice and tobacco. Also, the ABV is hardly noticeable here, with this drinking very smooth, with a great body and mouthfeel.",0.03892494720807615,0.9693

And low and behold, there it was on tap at the giant eagle marketplace in robinson. Look, I am not an imperial stout lover and I especially don't care for pastry stouts, so take this rating with a grain of salt and don't be insulted. First off, I'm pretty sure this is an imperial stout, not a pastry, not sure how this got into the pastry style but I've been following this brew for a long time and its always been a straight up impy stout - forget about the pastry fad thing. But anyway, form a tap this stuff has a nice smooth impy stout nose, not bad I think. The look in the eye of this is very pleasing, it seems to have legs as I roll it around the glass. It almost seems like its staining the glass. Taste is what else? Its very fine imperial stout, smooth and lacks most all the ill attributes I find in most domestic versions of this. Look, I don't care for impy stouts but this stuff is a little better than most I've tasted and I've tasted tons. It even has a slight sherry effect and I bet it would be great after it aged a few years or ten. Mouthcoating almost sweet finish. I was just glad just to finally have a chance to taste this.

AleSmith Speedway Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Black, deep and dark, completely opaque body topped by a khaki head, tall with excellent retention, thick and creamy. A thick wall of lacing is left as it does recede.

Aroma is not strong: roasted coffee, chocolate, and slightly sweet.

Initial taste is vanilla, followed by roasted coffee, then chocolate, then the bitterness from the hops. All of this intermingles nicely throughout. The underlying sweetness of the malts is never more than a background foundation. The foremost flavors are the interacting of chocolate and roasted coffee. The finish is bitter, with the aftertaste being somewhat sweet and bitter with roasted coffee. The bitterness and the roasted malts linger. This is a big beer, but, apart from the expected effects, the alcohol does not become obvious until near the end, when the beer has become well-warmed to room temperature, and even then, it is just a bit of warming at the finish.

AleSmith Speedway Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"355ml botttle bought at Cave Beer Point in Mei Foo.

Looks: Opaque deep Cola blackish brown colour with a thin layer of dirt-like yeast sediments; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy beige foam which fades in 10 seconds; Poor sticky lacing with zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with roastyness, strong whipped cream, waffles, tartness, strong Port-like alcohol, strong caramel, sticky toffee, strong milk coffee, chocolate, strong sugar, spices and sweet bread. Nice!

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with roastyness, strong tartness, strong soy sauce, strong black coffee, strong Cola, strong caramel, burnt toffee, burnt toast, cream, strong Port-like alcohol, strong dark chocolate, light floral, sugar, earth, spices, pine needles, dark bread, strong lemon, bitter hops and grass. Yum!

Body: Full body. Oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Full dark maltyness in a viscous background. Oily and, roasty with loads of nice soy sauce and tartness to hit, then comes with blissful booze laced with layers of strong caramel, burnt toast and toffee, cream, black coffee and dark chocolate. As if this is not enough, it’s well covered with piney hops-like spiceness to complement the restrained sweetness with lemony hops to round. I’m not worthy!

Booze: the 12% abv taste like a cross between Port wine and Sherry, the spicyness enhances the booze taste further much like North Coast Old Rasputin. Its present can be felt but is more comfy than aggressive, make it an easy to drink experience. Unbelievable!  

Hoppiness: Spice in nose, same in taste plus earth, pine, lemon and grass; Bitterness - burnt malt and hops - is quite strong and very dynamic for a lasting, close to high-level bitter roasted dark malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Roasty spicy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: RIS usually means an all-out war for the senses, not this one: I can feel the potency through it's rich aroma and taste, but underneath it is very subtle, with waves and layers to impress rather than a straight KO. This is a RIS which is toned to perfection and friendly to experts and newcomers alike. A classic!

The body is somewhat thinner, but I have already learned that from the few American samples that I have tried so far... My conclusion for now is that Americans obviously make thinner bodies than Europeans, which does not necessarily mean that it is worse, because such beers they drink more easily..

Considering the alcohol content, it is quite durable, the ring remains practically until the end. The beer is deep black in color, completely opaque. Intense aroma, dominated by noble alcoholism, liqueurism, roastiness, coffee and a bit of dark chocolate. In taste, despite its powerful body, it is quite dry, strongly roasted. In the foreground again, intense roastiness, coffee, noble alcoholism, and a bit of dessert chocolate. Fullness is high, carbonation low, bitterness medium high, with a roasted-alcohol character. The drink is thick and full-bodied, leaves a long aftertaste of coffee and roastiness, pleasantly warms the throat. The only thing I would consider a flaw is a bit too strong alcoholism.

Pitch black beer.

Aroma is specialty coffee, dark rye bread, dark chocolate, oats, toffee, hint of red berries, vanilla and toasted oak in a fantastic blend.

Taste is cappuccino, complex espresso, light coconut, oats, dark chocolate, vanilla, crema, charred oak and a light fruity note from the coffee.

Mouthfeel is unbelievably smooth with a perfect medium-low, soft carbonation. Very drinkable without ever feeling thin and while retaining a creamy feel. Plump body. Medium bitterness. Amazing pastry stickiness. Only small hints of alcohol (and they suit the beer) at this ABV, which is pretty ridiculous. This is how you do it. 

Overall: Thanks to BierCab Barcelona's amazing bottleshop, I finally managed to get ahold of this beauty. This is worthy of the hype!

Dark chocolate and toffee are most prevalent, but a lightly roasted coffee note balances while remaining smooth. A light creaminess tonthe body helps blend the flavors together.

AleSmith Speedway Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"Beautiful nougat colored persistent foam. Pleasant aroma of chocolate, coffee and a little licorice. There is dark bitter chocolate that is the main theme of this Imperial Stout, but in the aftertaste, it also develops a bit of bitter espresso coffee and a little English licorice as well as sweet hints of vanilla.

In taste, the beer is very smooth, perfectly composed. Sensations from the aroma appear again. Sweetness from vanilla, dried plum, chocolate, but rather the dessert kind, truffles, a lot of ""dark fruit"" sweetness, all this countered by balanced roasted bitterness.

AleSmith Speedway Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"The beer is completely black, a small layer of foam is created, which lasts until the end. The armoat is dominated by very distinct coffee in the best possible edition. The second fiddle in the aroma of this beer is of course played by chocolate notes, toffee and a light nutty note. The aroma is very pleasant and complex, medium intensity. The taste is very strong coffee from the first sip, and therefore associated with it high bitterness and slight acidity. There is also a large dose of roasted notes. Saturation at a low level, which definitely speaks in favor of this beer. I can't resist the impression that for such a balling (after converting from the original gravity of about 27 degrees) the beer has surprisingly little body, which improves drinkability and can be deceptive for 12% alcohol, which is however perfectly hidden, and therefore hardly noticeable.

750ml bottle poured in a Hill Farmstead taster. (bottle share)

A~ super hazy glowing yellow, not much of a head, and no lacing at all.

S~ tons of fermented honey, white grapes, vinegar and white wine. super strong acidity unlike any brew i’ve ever smelt.

T~ wow! this is crazy unique! pretty much follows the nose with more saison aspects. black pepper and bready yeast. all ending with a strong lemon vinegar tartness.

M~ not very carbonated but thats probably because the sample was saved for me. otherwise super smooth with the texture of dank lemonade. if this was freshly cracked i’m sure this would have had a nearly perfect score.

O~ definitely the most unique brew i’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing! i’m hoping this is still being done again but i’m sure it won’t be the same, this is just too crazy! hopefully its the same kind of wine barrel as well, the white wine/grape aspect is unreal! i seriously hope to have another chance to try this, 2 ounces was not enough!

EDIT FOR BATCH 2:
a lot brighter and way more citrus than batch 1. honey and white wine still very forward. so delicate and amazing all around!

It was an experience that transcended beer and life itself. Poured at the Hill Farmstead 7th anniversary week on Saturday. Spilt with some very generous and very hungover bros who I’ve never met before and will probably never see again. It was a perfect medley of honey, wine and funk that was more than the sum of its parts. Shared against the backdrop of the Vermont countryside, it was ethereal in every sense. It was too perfect for you to understand without being there yourself...without the setting, it doesn’t get a 5. Without the magnum it doesn’t get a 5.

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"May 2014 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.
Hazy burnished copper with a good amount of fairly well-retained white head atop.
Brightness of Anna lightly dulled, but in the best way possible, replacing it with soft lactic acids. Again more of the floral-sulfur-grass thing going on (that’s my closest approximation to describing the aroma of these wonderful saisons, and it’s admittedly terrible and sounds unappealing, but I’ll work on it once I get a whole bottle to myself....). Bits of honey on the end are just begging you to drink it.
Very well-restrained on the barrel character, compared to Art. Bright acidity, wildflower notes producing the same light stickiness. As it progresses, you get a pineapple-near-the-rind sort of flavor that is nicely dry but still has some good tartness and a pinch of sweetness. Bits of vanilla and light wood with some juicier melon notes. Hard to describe, these beers of Shawn’s. The flavors are all so new to me and it’s overwhelming to try them all for the first time this weekend. I can say that the mouthfeel, balance and attenuation are perfect here once again.
2014 375mL drunk 5/26/17 at the brewery.
Was really hoping to try the 2016 batch but they ONLY had the 2014.  DAMN.  Life is hard.
Still smells wonderful; tons of tart acidity, spicy phenols and floral character from the honey with very soft oak and rich honeyed malt tones through it all.  Very clean and much more gentle than when fresh.
Soft and very easygoing in the mouth with a lingering honey-like sweetness, soft wood tannins and lots of grass, juicy pineapple and melon.  The carbonation is very low at this point and maybe the 375mLs haven’t aged as gracefully as the larger format bottles, as this is just a touch tired (I wouldn’t continue aging these small bottles more than a year and would definitely drink them now), though certainly still highly enjoyable.  Bright acidity on the very end still helps enliven things but the tight, almost champagne-like carbonation that make Shaun’s sours so delightful is no longer very present here.",0.04410810913912309,0.9977

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"In short: An uber-rustic, oaky and honeyed blond Saison.  Elegant, complex, excellent.

How: Bottle 750ml, thick yellow bee wax.  Consumed 5 months after the beer release.  First batch (only batch so far).  Bottle #258.

The look: Cloudy blond body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention.
 
In long: Nose is very rustic, quite oaky and also a bit honeyed.  Overall very bright and clean nose that is a bit like Anna but with extra rusticity and oaky notes.  Taste starts with very nice crisp cereals, slightly honeyed and with a fresh hay sensation.  There’s a nice oak presence that is not overdone.  Also lemon zest, oaky white wine, a strong rustic yeast presence that doesn’t go into wild/brett territory, a fun cobweb sensation.  Dry oaky finish with the rusiticy shining.  A beer that is both nourishing and refreshing.  Superb mouthfeel with a full body and a lively carbonation.  The world that kept coming back to my mind was “elegant”.  Extremely pleasant to drink, this is almost a thirst beer which is very unusual for such a highly rated beer, high scores on ratebeer are usually reserved for high-intensity beers.  Hill Farmstead are brewing the best Saisons on the planet, no doubt about this anymore, and with a Saison lineup that includes Arthur, Art, Flora, Vera Mae, Civil Disobediences and more, I only rank Ann as a slightly above average Hill Farmstead Saison.

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Ann has a great cloudy golden straw appearance with a fluffy white cap.

The aroma is full of honey, white grapes, straw, and pale malts, with the microflora, pear, and lemon zest taking a bit of a backseat.

My first sip starts out nicely sweet with honey and light malts.  White grapes and pear add a little bit of fruit character to the sweetness.  Straw, grass, and a mineral presence come in later on, followed by a spicy oak note, with the finish ultimately being dry and clean.

Ann has a slightly heavier body than Anna does with a little bit less carbonation, but overall it still has a medium body with a moderate level of crisp carbonation.  There is a bit of a zesty tartness that will probably continue to develop over time.  It is fairly dry.

Even someone who does not go crazy for saisons has to appreciate the quality of a beer like this.  The original beer is delicate and complex, and the aging process has only added to the character.",0.0,0.9641

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Bottle #260. Thanks Shaun. Enjoyed at 55 Degrees F in a snifter on my GF’s birthday. 



A - The beeswax surrounding this bottle smells amazing. The best smelling bottle I’ve ever had.  Gorgeous clarity. Bright golden orange with a  3 finger fluffy solid white head. Head fades to a finger and remains. Pillow-like lacing sticks decently.  A very nice steady stream of bubbles travel bottom to top for as long as I’m drinking it. Looks a lot like a Prosecco.



S - Grape skins and lemongrass on the nose. Lots of characters that remind me of Prosecco and Sauvignon Blanc. Lovely citrus and wine tannins and a splash of honey sweetness.



T - Very sweet like lemon, tangerines and grapefruit. Dash of wine tannins at the finish with a super dry finish. I don’t pick up a lot of honey but there is this tart wild yeast aspect that compliments the excellent wheat and grassiness.



M - Medium body and a very nice balanced medium carbonation. A hint of an astringent listerine mouth wash finish but it’s not drastic and you really have to swish quite a bit to get it.



O - Hype, Hype, Hype. So Ann, the elusive Ann. Her? I’m enjoying drinking this right now. It’s tasty and enjoyable but I prefer Art which, for most purposes, is the best beer to compare with Ann. Juicy, Mimosa and Flora, in my opinion, exceed Ann in taste, body and the nose. Art is still the definite winner of Hill Farmstead Barrel Aged farmhouse ales. Would I pick up Ann again? OF COURSE!

Flavor adds much more wine character, tart strawberry, with that same otherworldly funk and fruit. Bone dry. Nearly flawless.",0.0,0.9332
Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Sharing this with a few of the guys today. What a great way to spend a Sunday afternoon.

Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

The beer is a beautiful golden color with a soft, white head. Noticeable lacing throughout the glass.

The aroma brings honey, grass, lemons, subtle funk, white wine, oak. Really complex and profound. The beeswax cap smells fantastic as well.

The flavor is a tad sweet, with a beautiful honey presence. Extremely well balanced. With every sip, a new flavor seems to emerge. Lovely white wine / white grape character. Pleasant, subtle tart character in the finish. Without doubt the most complex and gracefully balanced example of the style I have yet encountered. Like sipping a world class champagne or white wine.

Overall, this is certainly a stellar beer. I’m very glad that I was able to make it to this release and acquire this.

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Huge, huge thanks to Huhzubendah for sharing this bottle.  Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.  First off, the beeswax on the bottle is an excellent touch.  Not only does it look nice, but it smells phenomenal, setting the tone for the beer.  

The beer itself pours a nice, bright yellow.  Fairly clear with a huge white head and great retention.  As the head falls, heavy sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Collar throughout.  

The nose carries a wonderful mixture of white wine, honey, hay, lemon zest, very light barnyard, and a touch of acidity.  Masterfully blended so that each time I take another whiff, something else seems to come to the front.  The flavor is equally as integrated, and is aided by an absolutely incredible mouthfeel.  Some green grapes alongside lemon and hay.  Mild earthy funk behind a good dose of white wine.  Touch of oak.

Mouthfeel is crisp.  Very nice carbonation.  The mouthfeel is an enigma.  At the same time, there’s a touch of sweetness alongside a bit of white-wine tartness, mild funk, and touch of oak.  Each aspect is beautifully melded together.  Hard to describe.  The flavor lingers and is accentuated by mild acidity.  Saison and touch of pepper comes through at the very end.  

Overall, this tastes like the blood of a fallen beer god.  It’s just a gorgeous beer, and one of my top 5-10 of all time.  A wonderful experience, and something tells me, Shaun has better things yet to come.",0.0,0.9971
Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"750ml beeswaxed bottle opened on August 4, 2012. Batch 1, bottle #59. 



Golden yellow-orange with just over a finger of creamy, white head. 



Ann smells pungently of citrus, tropical fruit, and floral honey. The wine barrel aging works perfectly, imparting juicy lemon; a delicate grassiness; and ripe green grape; and hinting at a tickling acidity.



Ann is “not tame, but civil”—a pinch earthier and more obviously saison-like than the nose, with lemon verbena; citrusy, almost limey tartness; and a sweet-grassiness. Ann remarkably balances a number of disparate elements—most obviously, the citrusy sweet elements (lemon/tropical fruit) with the citrusy tart elements.  



I’m thankful I have another bottle, which means that I can enjoy it without studying it.  One of my favorites from Shaun.",0.0,0.9706

Tastes as good as it smells.  Medium body, very creamy.  The mouthfeel is as impressive as the aroma and flavor.  I do not rate many beers, but this is perfect for a funky/sour saison.

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"Bottle, thanks Shaun.   Poured into the brewers stemware.  Natural hazy golden pour with a medium sized fine bubbled white head with lots of lace.   Super clean and tart nose, wine barrel comes through but harmonizes so naturally with the base beer that you’d think it was always meant to be there.  Light honey, lemon, oak.   Fantasticly integrated flavor as well and not as wine dominant as some of HFB other wine barrel aged beers. Slightly slick and acidic palate, could stand for a touch more crispness but I’m not sure if that’s really a legitimate critique.   But this is a damn fine beer.  Shit, I’m really having trouble finding a way to take points away from this beer and it’s everything I want in a saison plus more.  This sorta reminds me of Shaun’s Saison Lambic Pinot Noir that he brewed in Denmark for the Norreboro brewery with the o’s that have lines going through them possibly diagonally but this is better.  I can honestly say that I’d rather be home here in NC drinking this awesome beer than to be in LA right now drinking copious amounts of awesome shit with my homies.

Hill Farmstead Ann🇺🇸Saison / Farmhouse / Grisette,"750 mL bottle shared on Friday night of the 2nd Anniversary party by Shaun. Generally, this is Anna aged in Sauvignon Blanc barrels. 

Frothy, retentive near white head settles on a hazed golden body, slowly fading to a finger thick head and thin sheets of lace. Nose if funky, fruity and mildly sour. Medium light body, effervescent carbonation, and soft full texture. The barrel aging adds a dimension missing from the base beer, adding a strong white grape and light lactic sour presences; overall sweet and fruity though out, but well balanced and a dry finish.

Light body with pillowy effervescence and a dry crisp finish. I absolutely loved this beer, and it was one of the highlights of the event for me. 




Re-rate from a release bottle. Shared with my dad on my birthday. Nice to revisit this beer when I am completely sober. I certainly wasn’t for my original rating, but surprisingly I captured it pretty well. Very vinous, funky, and lactic, with vibrant nectar and tropical fruits trailing off with mead like notes.

Schramm's Black Agnes🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"$35, only 11% bottle at a small but interesting bottle shop in Grapevine Texas.

Low-ball glass at the employee lodge under a desk lamp.

Pour is a very dark but very clear, syrupy, ruby Robitussin. Some of the cork dusted off into my drink.

Smell is very vinous & stemmy. Slightly medicinal, herby honey. Sharp currants & black cherry pits. There is more honey in the nose than  anticipated.

Taste is oily, lemon honey on the stove when you're sick. Middle kicks in the currant, black cherry, sour plum & Pinot Noir. Lots of skin, but so bittersweet in both directions. The bitterness is leafy, twiggy & constant. The honey body & sweetness propels all the fruit forward, not able to express itself fully. So tart in between. I did want more honey character. It's there in spots, but it's fighting a losing battle with all this fruit. A more robust variety next time.

The body is oily, rich, tannic, warming, thick & inviting.

Schramm's Black Agnes🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"Batch 4 bottle, shared by ygtbsm94 on 10/8/16, thanks Brad!
Dark, violet-chartreuse body shows good clarity and high viscosity.
Very tart, tannic and piquant in the nose, showing strong currant that probably outdoes the sweentess in the mead. Very authentic fruit character as always from these guys, with earth, spice and strong honey-vanilla backing it. Great strength of aroma and low alcohol while exceptionally clean.
Very, very tart and tannic in the mouth, the soft, sugar-laden texture certainly comforts the palate, but I’m less in love with the hard, nearly astringent acidity from the fruit here as opposed to most other, softer fruits. Of course, black currants are a very tart, astringent, acidic fruit and I like that it’s presented here, as is. Clean, low alcohol and wonderful, lush fruit flavors and sugars abound. Hard to imagine these guys making a bad mead.

Batch 10 bottle, drunk 9/20/17.
Bright piquant currant, with tons of spicebox, various vinous notes and light crayon-like waxines.  No booze, not sugary and quite nicely balanced by the acidity and tannin.  Quite mellow and syrupy through the front ending more mellow as a good balance is achieved.",0.0,0.9857

Thick and heavy, dark purple with a little pink in the mix. There is no head, other than a couple small bubbles, bright purple in color, due to the pour. The aroma is very heavy. There is a lot of booze and a wine character to it. The currants are there in force, but the sweetness is a little overshadowed by the booze. The flavor is unbelievable. It starts a little hot, but the immediate aftertaste is magnificent. It starts a little tart, and slowly moves into a beautiful sweet currant. The sweetness is amazing. It's very jammy. The mouth feel is spot on. There is a good thickness with hardly any carbonation, and just a lingeringly coating, fruitiness. It's great. This is a spectacular mead. You would never guess that this was 14% by the flavor. The aroma gives it away, but this is the first mead I've really, really likes. Hot damn did Schramm's nail this.

Schramm's Black Agnes🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"375ml bottle courtesy of and shared with Meadme. First, I must say how hard it is to rate these meads. How to even compare this complexity to traditional meads such as we find in Poland. How does one go from rating a traditional mead aged for 15 years to a fruit loaded Schramm’s that’s nowhere near the same? yet this one sits in the top 5? Still, great stuff.

Deep purple color, nothing shines through like light. Oily in the glass.
Aroma is purely and simply blackcurrant, as if kilos of blackcurrant had been poured into it. Finds a fine honeyed, earthy fruit. Palate is huge, full of blackcurrant, punctuated by the sweetness of honey and at this point we can’t really say that we recognize the type of honey as the blackcurrant is so dominant. Finds an astringent note with fine tannin, sticky to the lips. Absolutely fantastic even though I had heartburn right after, to say how intense it is.

Side Project Beer : Barrel : Time - 2017🇺🇸Stout - Imperial,"From notes. Enjoyed at the Side Project Cellar, with Gus, on November 24. 750 mL bottle, black wax. The pour is a nice dark black motor oil with a dark film of espresso colored ring of head with no lace as it lingers. The aroma is great. There is a dark chocolate and heavy roasted malt with a beautiful leathery undertone. A lightly bitter earthy hop comes in late and the vanilla comes through with a strong oak on the finish. This is complex and deep, but the hop is a little too detectable. The flavor is much of the same. The bit bitterness up front works with the light alcohol before the roasted malt, leather, tobacco, and a hint of oak lead away from the hop and finish with an almost dark fruit heaviness. The light vanilla and oak again bring up the back and this warms all the way down. The mouth feel is lighter heavy bodied with a soft carbonation and a nice charred oak and bitter chocolate roasted malt on the finish.

Pours a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown with a small dark tan/brown head that settles into a ring. This is somewhat jarring next to Derivation #8 because, as the description details well, there are no adjuncts in here and D8 is popping with vanilla and coffee and coconut. There is also a lot more balance between barrel and base than the first iteration of BBT on draft, which was called Barrel-Aged Time when it debuted for the Coffee Crawl in 2017. That one, with the old Heaven Hill barrel, was intense in the way it soaked up the barrel, and was bourbon-forward and almost dry. This one certainly has plenty of oak and vanilla and slight char and toasted sugar, balanced by roasted malts and dark chocolate. Medium-plus bodied, with modest carbonation and a smooth, roasty, rich mouthfeel. Excellent. It's being overshadowed by D8, but that's expected. Great in its own right.",0.1318760946791574,0.8823

Trappistes Rochefort 10🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"Visually very dark mahogany in color. The light brown, fine-pored head appears fluffy and ""only"" moderately long-lasting, which is not surprising given such a high alcohol content. The aromas pamper you with incredibly strong notes of spicy forest honey, dark caramel, light hints of chocolate, Powidl, dried fruit notes of cherry, berries, plum and fig, as well as a hint of sherry and/or port wine. Incredibly complex! The first sip is soft, sweet and broadly malty to ripe fruity with light hints of dried fruit and rum pot. A powerful, warming body spreads in the mouth with a gentle and slightly sparkling effervescence, heavy, oily texture, slight dryness and present sweetness. Complex notes of dark caramel, light chocolate, fruity dried fruit (cherry, berries, plum, fig) and slightly rum-like notes reminiscent of rum pot can be seen on the tongue and palate, and these can even lead to notes of sherry and port wine. I think you can tell that you are dealing with a very high level of complexity that results in an incredible and harmonious overall picture. Drinkability is not an issue at 11.3% (!!!) - but this quadruple is not too heavy or overwhelming. In the aftertaste, all the aromas have a very good and long-lasting effect with a light sweetness, a lovely warmth and a slightly alcoholic note. Only after a longer time do you notice a very delicate, dry bitterness, which is still backed by a pleasant chocolate note.

Trappistes Rochefort 10🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"""Quadrupel"" - ""the strongest Rochefort"" - ""11.3% vol."" were all keywords that prompted me to taste just one beer today. Sugar and wheat starch are also noticeable here. Spices were omitted. Trappistes Rochefort 10 smells of alcohol, caramel and roasted aromas. The beige head is as thick as a thumb, mixed-pore and then remains stable at a low level. The color is almost black. On the first sip, the taster is greeted by a complex, almost incomprehensible variety of flavors. Nevertheless, I will try to name a rough selection: sherry, raisins, coffee, honey, wine from Beerenauslese. On the finish, yeast prevails and hop bitterness sets in slightly.

Trappistes Rochefort 10🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"It has a dark brown color, cloudy, with an earthy appearance. It forms an ivory-colored foam, with little persistence and medium retention. Medium bubbles.
It forms a good lace.
On the nose it is very aromatic, very complex. With sweet aromas, notes of ripe fruits, plum, raisins, dates stand out, at the same time the aroma of Kola nut, vanilla, caramel stands out. The hops are perceived thanks to a subtle floral note in the background. It is rare but on other occasions I had noticed more the presence of banana notes, on this occasion they are very slight. The presence of alcohol is perceived but in a subtle way.
On the palate it is congruent with the aroma. It begins with a soft sweetness that highlights the presence of notes of Kola nut, vanilla, malt. At the same time the nose is filled with that aromatic, floral hop, which dresses the experience in the mouth without bothering or interrupting. 
The aftertaste is balanced, with a slight sweetness and a mild bitterness. 
With a medium to full body and medium carbonation.

*Note: on this occasion I noticed it was very aromatic, almost like a perfume. I had never smelled a beer like that, not even the Rochefort 10, but it is almost as if I were drinking a very seductively perfumed beer.",0.0,0.9666

Cloudy dark brown with a nice, but diminishing beige head. Deep, complex, and very vinous aroma that brings your thoughts to a nice Barolo wine. Intoxicating notes of sherry and burned figs.

We first entered The Subterranean Drinking Den without knowing truly what we were in for. 

My friend was shy at first, but with my support ordered the Rochefort 10 biere aka the brain-leg dis-connector. 

When the bottle was opened, the sweet aroma of the monastery filled the bar, everyone in the close vicinity looked around and asked, ""what is that?"" - me and my friend were shocked to say the least. Hints of Madagascan Vanilla pods mixed with Ecuadorian Cocoa beans hit the the two external openings to the nasal cavity in the nose. Simply put, a sense of enlightenment brought from the monks' biblical teachings spilled out in the room from the bouteille.

Now that the bottle opening is settled, we can move onto the pour. Exquisitely dark, the pour was like a river flowing through the desert solely on a mission to quench ones first.

The beer pours a medium brown with light bleeding through at the edges giving it a reddish tint. A three finger tan head that dissipates down surprisingly quickly. Lots and lots of micro bubbled streams of carbonation. The carbonation eases out over the life of the drink quite dramatically. Almost taking it to flat bitter level by the final gulp.

The taste is extremely well balanced and moreish without ever being overstated. Caramel malt, spicy coriander. Sweet sugar, raisins and prunes. A little yeast. The slightest hop bitterness. Very easy going on the palate for such high ABV.

What I love about this personally is that it feels a little bit more bitter and spicy than its contemporaries, while also being quite rich, although perhaps just a tad too boozy at the same time. Overall this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quadrupel that's quite hard to beat at its availability and price point. Perhaps a little too boozy, but making up for that with its more bitter and spicy accents, never feeling quite too sweet, as many other examples of the style.",0.14673479641335554,0.8868

Trappistes Rochefort 10🇧🇪Quadrupel / Abt,"""O time! Suspend your flight""... There are some tastings that we would like to last forever. This Rochefort 10 is one of them. Everything is there, balance, power, intensity for a beer that is not the easiest to understand. It took me 999 tastings to begin to understand it. And I say begin, because dozens of tastings of this marvel would not be enough to understand it completely. Just like other Belgian Trappist beers, we of course discover this mastery that only several generations have managed to achieve. But this Rochefort 10 is more difficult to access, even compared to a Westleveren, as its alliance is so specific and its balance complex. At the beginning of my initiatory journey, I therefore appreciated it little, not knowing how to decode it. So I must believe that I was well trained, and for that I thank Corkyrory who accompanied me and who still accompanies me. This tasting is therefore dedicated to him, it is both a thank you and a tribute. And without a doubt he would be able to speak much better than me about this Rochefort. Visually it is a pretty brown that presents itself to us, topped with a 5 mm beige foam. The nose is a firework: plum, prune, liquorice, clove, hint of chocolate, apple, pear, madeira wine and a very tonic alcohol mix in a powerful, elegant, rich, complex cocktail. When tasting, the same explosion with a remarkable tension in the mouth. Superb balance on the attack with the anise and liquorice which stand out slightly from the crowd. The second mouth is superb with a strengthening alcohol and an exceptional complexity. On the back palate, prune and liquorice take the ascendancy somewhat with an alcohol at its maximum intensity, allowing strength and contrast. The finish is long and distinguished… a marvel.",0.0512989176042577,0.9966

I like the bottle, the simple print, old fashioned, simple bottle... I remember for a long time they didn't have a marked glass, they would serve it in the standard trappist glass... that was clever, it made it to me 'the standard of all beers'... now they have their own glass... 
The name - strong rock - and the fact that it comes from the mysterious Ardennes, the highlands where time goes slower and people still put love in their foodstuffs. 
You have to pour it fast for it to make some foam, if you poor it careful like most other beers, it just doesn't make a 'collar'... 
The taste and smell are a mix of all good things like chocolate cake, fudge, caramel, dulce di leche, port.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"32 oz. screw-top growler graciously shared by Dave. Originally reviewed 6/29/2012.

Pours an incredibly flat inky black. Glass-staining, as always. Viscous, but no head. Bummer. Growler, maybe?

Nose is brandy, booze, and, well, standard Hunahpu aromas. Chilies and chocolate. And more booze. The brandy aroma is a little on the sickly sweet side, though. Really detracts, I think.

Tastes awfully sweet at the start. Brandy comes through, but it isn’t an imposing flavor, except for the sweetness. Chocolate and chilies are still pretty potent in this treatment. Thick and sweet and syrupy, though. Every bit of sugar is amplified by the brandy.

Thick and boozy. Still has the wonderful viscosity of Hunahpu, though, but it tastes every bit of 11.5% and then some. The sugar doesn’t help.

Not an impressive treatment. It’s still a fascinating combination of flavors, but not something that improves upon the original beer.",0.0,0.9849

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Original review (2012-07-16): Gloops from the bottle as any Zhukov-based brew should. Tremendous roast in the nose with brandy and caramely notes. Lots of complexity here, though I wish it were more pungent. 



Taste is marvelously complex with brandy, booze, vanilla, spice, and plenty more that end up dancing atop the delicious stout base. Chiles are mild, where they belong. The trademark Hunahpu’s chocolate, vanilla, and chile aftertaste gets a boost from the brandy as it tickles the back of my throat upon swallowing. Ultra-viscous body, as expected, and just amazing.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Poured from a 32 oz. growler into a snifter.

Like the regular Hunahpu’s, the Apple Brandy Barrel Aged Hunahpu’s pours a viscous dark black chocolate color with a barely noticeable tan head around the ring of the glass.

The aroma is full, complex, and somehow elevated beyond the greatness the original Hunahpu’s achieves.  The brandy is noticeable and seems to gently overlay the other aromas, which are consistent with the regular Hunahpu’s: dark chocolate, a bit of espresso, vanilla, with a bit of pepper and a slightly fruity apple presence.

Each sip is nearly perfect.  The dark chocolate fudge, roasted malt, and creamy espresso notes all blend amazingly well with a brandy flavor.  The middle of the sip contains the zenith of its complexity, with the apple coming through, mixing with oak and vanilla from the barrel, and a bit of residual chocolate flavor.  The end of the sip wraps the treat up nicely, leaving a nice brandy flavor in my mouth.

The brandy mellows out the sticky sweetness that the base beer contains, and the barrel definitely lightens up the carbonation a little bit as well.  It is creamy and smooth, with the brandy cutting through the thickness of Hunahpu’s as well.  This beer really just has the perfect body, carbonation, and smoothness that I am looking for.

After tasting Hunahpu’s for the first time I did not think there was any way to improve on it, but after having the whiskey and the brandy, I have changed my opinion.  This is such an incredible beer.",0.0,0.9555

Viscous, pitch black, very dark mocha head, that fades to a small skim with a bit of sticky lacing.  Aroma is all barrel.  Booze, brown sugar, light chili heat right at the very end.  Not much of the base beer makes it through.  The taste though...wow.  Perfect blend of chocolate, lots of chocolate, more chocolate, some smoke, earth, a bit of spicy chili heat,  light wood, brown sugar and booze.  Thick mouthfeel and a lasting finish.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Big fliptop shared by Tooch. Thanks, buddy. Really exciting beer to finally try. Pours a rich inky black thick pour, a small dark brown head atop dies to a ring, laces small. Thick and inky, dark and ominous. Aromas are richer chocolate chip cookies, cocoa, and biscuits. Touches of oak, vanilla, and touches of apples grow. Cocoa, coffee, and vanilla, gentle spirit, touches of dark fruit. A gentle kiss of spice. Initial is fuller bodied, with cocoa and caramel, smoothed out barrel elements offer oak, vanilla, and some mellow apple brandy spirit. Smooth spirit, brandy, and oak, well integrated with richer fudge, roast, and mellow coffee roast. Smooth, the barrel integrates well with a kiss of spice. A very well done barrel aged stout, firm sweetness countered with a touch of thinness with barrel, oak, and brandy. Vanilla, touches of roast, toast, smokey elements still stick around. No real spice. But smokey, smooth and silky, with a good barrel presence that integrates well. It loses the base nature of the beer, but still tastes great. I’m still out the Bourbon version, but so far, this one of my favorite barrel variant of the series. Very nice.",0.08873565094161137,0.9895

pours as only a CCB imperial stout can. thick as motor oil but silky smooth capped by a rich, dense, red-clay colored head that stains the hell out my Hunahpu’s snifter and leaves beautiful rings of lace. aroma is nothing short of divine with all that is great about the base beer...dense dark chocolate, heavy roast, a touch of toasted cedar, burnt cinnamon, smoked chilis, molasses, and espresso backed by elegant notes of wet oak, baked cinnamon apples, and sweet, boozy brandy that really pops as it warms in the glass. flavor is a near out-of-body experience with the oak, sweet brandy, and subtle apple notes complimenting and adding a level of complexity to the heavy dark chocolate fudge, espresso, vanilla, cinnamon, and smoked notes of the base Hunahpu’s but allowing the rich toasted cedar and mild chili spice to still shine on the back end. palate is sheer perfection as well with the bold, imposingly thick, yet smooth as silky mouthfeel i’ve come to love in the base Hunahpu’s with a long, lingering finish of subtle chili spice, dark chocolate, and sweet brandy. overall, this may be the single best beer i’ve ever tasted. it’s an absolute marvel and a testament to barrel aging. wow.",0.08980265101338744,0.9979

A - Pours absolutely pitch black with a small dark brown head that leaves sticky brown lacing down most of the glass.




S - A bit on the sweet side with a strong aroma of brandy. A bit of chocolate and some sort of spices? Could that be the chillies from the non-BA version? I might need another glass to determine if it is...




T - Starts out with some mild sweetness from the apple brandy slowly developing into an amazing line-up of cinnamon, chocolate, and some faint spices.

M - Heavy body and flavor with good carbonation. It has a very full body but it is very well rounded. The brandy flavor is strong but not too overpowering.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Cigar city brandy hunahpus (bottle number 65 of 84). Thanks to Sean.  In celebration of his engagement and my 2000th rating... Pours a smooth  
viscous deep black pour, silky in nature, with a thin wispy dark khaki  
head... Aroma is laiden with sweet brandy forwardness, semi- 
bittersweet velvety chocolate, while the chiles are still quite  
apparent and noticeable which is equally impressive for that matter. Some char and  
light ash from the base Zhukov providing some complimentary details to an already beautiful nose... Flavors are a smooth transition from  
the aroma with an equally rich and assertive profile. Semi-charred  
from the base Zhukov which then evolves to a richer atmosphere with brandy  
along with its fruity esthers. Chocolate tones are quite evident, so  
rich and so smooth and semi-sweet in nature. Chiles surface every now  
and again which is a pleasant surprise as I was expecting for this quality to have fallen off due to its age and time spent in the barre. Body is thick and filling, almost  
fudgy. Carbonation is light but noticeable. Abv is slightly warming overall but really held at bay for the most part. Quite the experience and  
well worth it for such a milestone.

Nose of brandy, vanilla bean, assorted chilis and cocoa powder. Taste is simply divine and can best be described as assorted chili peppers wrapped in cocoa leaves resting on a bed of vanilla beans.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"On tap at CCB during the Hunahpu’s release party. 

A: Look was very similar to regular Hunahpu’s, as well as bourbon Hunahpu’s, which made for some fun at the table. Very dark black with a very rich deep tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing. 

S: The smell of brandy is immediately present alongside all of those other beautiful scents that come along with the regular version. It’s quite nice and not overpowering, but at the same time I’m not sure it really complements the essence of the Hunahpu’s all that much. Left me wondering whether a ""Humidor Series"" Hunahpu’s would have been even more outstanding. Still, very beautiful nose that I won’t actually complain about.

T: Very similar assessment to the nose. The brandy actually did work pretty well, and I think this is true more so for the taste than the nose; however, still not quite a perfect 5. Again, didn’t like the taste as much as the standard Hunahpu’s, as I felt that some of the more subtle flavors from the original version might have a bit lost.

M: Superb. Very thick and viscous and good carbonation for the style. 

D: Very beautiful. Although not nearly as drinkable as the standard version, that one was well past the standard 5.0, so I have no problem giving that to the brandy version as well. Just a beautiful sipping beer.

Serving type: on-tap

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"On tap at hawthornes. 8oz pour in tulip glass.
A: Pitch black. No head, no skim, no lacing. Just a thick motor oil look alike.

S: Light apple brandy lays atop the profile from start to finish. Underneath are spicy chili peppers, cinnamon, roasted malt, cocoa and traces of vanilla and oak.

T: Like the nose, its clear right away that the beer was treated with some time in apple brandy barrels. It isn;t overwhelming however and complements the rich spicy flavors of the base beer well. Chili peppers pop out on the tongue and are rounded out with sweet cinnamon, cocoa, vanilla and a bit of caramel.

M: Thick and smooth. Lightly carbonated (in a good way). A bit of warming heat, but not overpoweringly boozy.

O: I plowed through this beer fairly quickly (unintentionally). It just went down real well despite its massive body and substantial flavoring. As noted above this was much better than the pour I got the day before at Capones. Its amazing how different they were. Capones was almost all brandy, killing off the peppers and cinnamon.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Thanks for sharing this rarity, Nick.

Black as pitch and quite viscous, there isn’t much of a head, but it does have nice legs.

It smells strangely muddled. Bittersweet dark chocolate, a touch of tart apple, some leathery oxidation. The barrel aging seems to have actually simplified the beer and covered up most of the pepper, vanilla and cinnamon. As it warms, it becomes dominated by heavily roasted, tarry, almost burnt malt and sweet brandy. Not bad, but haphazard.

The apple brandy flavor comes through pretty strongly on the palate. It hints at apple, but it’s more of an indistinguishable fruity sweetness. There’s a little vanilla and oak, lots and lots of bitter baking chocolate, barely perceptible chili pepper. This is a huge, chewy imperial stout, almost Dark Lord-esque in viscosity. The finish is mildly boozy with lingering flavors of bitter chocolate, licorice, earthy oxidation and faint chili pepper. Barrel aging seems to have covered up the boldness of the adjunct ingredients in this beer, transforming it into something that’s enjoyable but ultimately muddled. Perhaps Hunahpu’s wasn’t the best beer to put in a barrel. Pretty good, I enjoyed my glass, but it’s not outstanding. There are a number of better and less rare barrel aged imperial stouts out there.",0.0,0.9939

Super thick and viscous with about the darkest brown head of any beer I’ve ever seen. A gentile swirl in the glass leaves a slightly golden brown motor oil stain on the sides of my glass. As with the bourbon version, the barrel aging mutes some of the original awesomeness of the aroma. Very light pepper/chili notes. Fairly heavy on the alcohol, but thankfully the stink of isovaleric acid that was so prevalent in the bourbon version is absent here. Mild wet wood notes. The vanilla and peppers come up a bit more as the beer nears room temperature. Decent... but fairly average barreled aroma. The barrel shows itself much more on the tongue than on the nose. Lush flavors of peppers, vanilla, decadent milk chocolate, toasted nuts immediately come to the tongue. Further warming brings out the wood and brandy flavors. The base beer is pretty much gone with the barrel leaving a goddamn decadent imperial stout. Slightly tart granny smith apples, plenty of warming (but not distracting) alcohol, wet wood... Huge mouthfeel but never syrupy or cloying. Damn near reminiscent of cask Darkness. Ultra velvety and smooth throughout.  Bitter chocolate with a kiss of heat and wood tannin on the finish.

Aroma was solid cherry, apple and alcohol, with only hints of coffee.  As it warmed, you could pick up a bit of smokiness from the peppers and a touch of cinnamon, but the brandy still dominated.

Flavor was very sweet dark chocolate covered fruit.  Slightly dry smoky tobacco finish.  As it warmed, you got a bitt more flavor from the peppers and felt the slightest tingle on the tongue.

This is an incredibly smooth and drinkable imperial stout that needs no further age.  

Overall, this tasted like a solid imperial stout aged a bit too long in brandy.  However....

6/6/10 at Hawthorne Cafe: This was like a completely different beer.  I got a ton of pepper and smoke in the nose right from the start, but just balanced with the cinnamon and brandy.  This was much more balanced and tasted like what I would expect from taking a great base imperial stout (Hunahpu’s) and throwing it in brandy.  The aging was a great complement.

The appearance is rich dark chocolatey, but the head dropped off a lot. The body is lighter and smoother than the original, with the cacao coming out and coconut throughout. Rerated on a growler from Alex and this is a different experience all together! The perfect aroma brings a sweet chocolate stout and sweet brandy booze, but the smoothest and most pleasant I could never have expected in this nose.

Still a big, burly imperial stout, however many of the more subtle notes of the Hunaphus—particularly the chili peppers, cinnamon—were no longer anywhere to be found, replaced with strong, boozy grape and licorice notes.

Just because this is a Wayne Wambles stout, it will be a 5 in both appearance and palate.  Just perfect.  Oily, viscous and thick with a deep tan head.  Aroma of sweet caramel apples and vanilla.

The apple brandy gives a great sweet caramel flavor and some of the apple flavors you would expect, with the strong roasted flavors of the stout lingering in the background.  This is a great beer, but I find the regular Hunahpu’s and the Bourbon Hunahpu’s a little better.  The sweetness from the apple brandy is just a little too much.  Still, an elite brew.",0.0,0.9618

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Draft at the brewery.  Pours as dark as night, resembling an oil slick more than beer with all it’s dense viscosity.  A thick and lasting head of dark brown foam leaves behind a glass staining wash of suds and bubbles.  In short, it looks damn perfect.  The nose is just ridiculous, showing a complex and complimentary blend of dark cocoa, vanilla, creamy coconut, and candied apples.  Of course, the anchos and pasillas shine through, along with the cinnamon, to complete the signature peppery Hunahpu aroma that has been ever so slightly kissed by the rich brandy oak.  Flavors too are mighty fine, showing wave after decadent wave of rich dark chocolate, caramel, cafe mocha, and even glazed donuts.  Coconut again makes an appearance, which is one of my favorite things about this beer.  Lightly peppery, the zestiness seems to have been cut down a little by the sweet apple barrel, but you can still pick it out.  On the palate, this stuff is as thick and rich as they come, proudly displaying a whipped, creamy body.  If there’s a flaw, it’s that there’s maybe a shade too much sweetness, but it is negligible.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Apple Brandy Barrel Aged🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"A huge thanks to ArthurPendragon for flying out to FL, getting this growler filled, flying to Chicago, and meeting Alex at Midway just for us to sample this beer! You da man!

I was told the keg blew about 80% into the fill on this growler, so we did get pretty lucky! From a smallish (not sure the ounces) Cigar City Growler into a mini-snifter.

A - Pours black, super-oily resin along the sides of the glass, motor oil to the maximum. Some bubbles, but mostly, just a black. The sticky look of this beer looks cool, no doubt about it.

S - A perfect mix of sweet apples, brandy, and the base Hunahpu’s beer. The Laird’s complements the Hunahpu’s so well, it’s hard to describe how good this beer really is. I enjoyed the base beer so much alone, this was even better. You get the chili notes mixed in there as well, very complex.

T - Everything I got from the nose, I also got on the palate. I would say it’s even more complex on the palate. I can really taste all the different things going on with this beer. As complex as the base beer is, this is even moreso. Apple Brandy, chilis, molasses, toffee, burnt sugars, etc. 

M - Full bodied, slight carbonation, rich and smooth.

D - I had a decently-sized sample that I really enjoyed. I wanted more, but alas, there wasn’t enough after everyone got their pour. Who knows if I’ll ever try this again, probably not. This was an epic beer!

Probably my favorite treatment of this beer, except maybe for the bourbon aged version when it was first released several months back.
The beer is charcoal-black and pours thick and slowly, like cascading black lava, onto the snifter. Leaves about a 1/3 of an inch of foamy head at the top. Head has the color of fresh cappuccino. 
In the nose I get a lot of sweet brandy notes with hints of alcohol heat, but not overbearing at all. Also some very nice vanilla, caramelized sugar and toffee. 
The front palate gets that sweet brandy heat almost right away, followed by oak, dark chocolate, vanilla and in the back  that ancho chile that made hunahpu’s famous creeps in slowly.

Easily the best beer of the night IMHO and the best Hunahpus treatment I’ve had so far.  Both the nose and the flavor of this beer are complex and multi layered  the brandy is present in both but not over powering, more soft and subtle.  I really smell and taste all of the base Hunahpus ingredients with the brandy it’s very harmonious.  Huge notes of fudge, roasted malt, cinnamon, and vanilla blended very nicely with notes of brandy, wood, and mild char, at first the peppers are really only experienced in the back of the throat but as the beer warms the peppers become much more apparent in the flavor and nose giving it the character of a mole.  Huge creamy, velvety mouth feel, if you like big, full, chewy bodies as I do, I’d say this is perfect.  As the pitch black beer retreats it leaves my glass heavily stained as with all CCB stouts.

Undetermined clarity, dark mahogany with deep burgundy highlights in the light.  Medium-sized, tan head shows moderate retention.
Nose is beautiful and well-aged.  None of the unfermented sugars and syrupy fudge that so many stouts have these days.  The adjuncts are done incredibly tastefully, as well with none of it jumping out or dominating.  Dark chocolate, vanilla, moderate roast and ample sweet caramel from the malt with no alcohol, even after warming.  Everything melds together so well and it's shocking to me that this is a mere 21 months in bottle.  Drinks like it's homogenized for 5 years.
Soft, malty, rich and yet wonderfully attenuated.  Near-perfect balance giving appropriately chewy, luxurious textures with no syrupy sweetness or any fatiguing sugar on the finish.  Cinnamon spiciness helps balance and vanilla is soft and flavorful.  Nothing jumps out and this is a study in balance and finesse.  Through all that, it's still pleasingly rich and satisfying.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Pretty crazy that I never got on the Cigar City train - just missed the boat.  Glad to finally try this and I see now why Cigar City hit it big.   Hard to believe they've created this much depth, complexity and balance without barrel aging. This puts many barrel aged stouts to shame, which is impressive. 9/4/9/5/19

It's thick and full (although it holds back just enough not to be syrupy), and the flavors are a brilliant combination of chocolate, coffee, and a little bit of toasted/roasted grain.

The taste is once again dominated by cinnamon, faint chocolate, subdued chilli, it doesn't bite in the throat.

It just puts the icing on the cake.
The alcohol is hard to define, it's not at all mild, but that could be because of the chilli.

Cinnamon notes are present from the beginning - not too intense, balanced, rather remain in the background, but are consistently present until the end. Sweet taste, such a liquid cinnamon cookie, sometimes with elements of such organic honey. Towards the end, hot pepper enters, I don't know whether it diversifies or disrupts the whole. It is certainly not irritating. It is also certainly a certain variety and breaks this sweetness of the beer. Drinkability at an impressively and dangerously high level. Perfectly balanced beer.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"A perfect imperial stout. Deep body, brown-red head, medium head. The aroma is rich cocoa, coffee, vanilla, a little caramel, with distinct layers. The body is thick and sticky, as if drinking melted dark chocolate, and after entering the throat, there is a sweet aftertaste of toffee and chocolate, plus a little bit of pepper piercing the throat. This wine is excellent in any latitude, with excellent balance. It has no barreling but has a complexity that many barreled wines cannot achieve, which makes people look forward to its double barrel version.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"From notes. 750 mL bottle shared with ebone1988. 2014 vintage. The pour is a thick dirty motor oil black with a finger of dark mocha head that fades foam ring, leaving no lace behind. The aroma is beautiful. There is a ton of cinnamon in front of a light cocoa and a lot of vanilla. The chilies don't really dominate, but offer a good peppery spiciness that is incredibly well balanced. The cinnamon comes back and is delightful. I love the smell on this. The flavor is great. Copious amounts of cinnamon up front and they ease through a nice pepper transition into a soft cocoa and vanilla, before reentering the cinnamon realm. The fact that the chilies are reserved makes this so much better. The mouth feel is thick and viscous. Great carbonation help it just cling to the mouth in a never ending film. The aftertaste is all cinnamon and subtly it moves through a good chocolate and vanilla lingering finish. Damn good.

In the mouth I was struck by the prominence of spices that I had been unable to anticipate when smelling the beer. The mixture of spices is surprising and also very complex and homogeneous.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Originally reviewed 6/10/2011. 750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. As black as they come. Not even a hint of brown in the stream of the pour as it comes out of the bottle. It foams up nicely as I pour it with a dark brown head. The only thing that’s missing is lacing, which is minimal. Unbelievable aroma. Deep dark chocolate. The friend I split it with said it smells like ""really expensive chocolate."" Roasty aromas abound with the chocolate and a slight burning in the nose from the alcohol and peppers. Delightful.
Taste is an immediate hop bitterness that fades immediately to a strong flavor of dark chocolate. The pepper flavor burns the taste buds just slightly throughout the entire drink, never allowing the sweetness to overwhelm. In the middle are the dark roasted malt flavors, followed by a finish that wants to be sweet, but can’t overcome a hop bitterness and peppery bite.

There’s heavy and chewy, but this is ridiculous.One of the heaviest beer I’ve ever had. Pretty high in carbonation considering the ABV and weight of the beer. Gives it a good tingle that complements the peppers nicely.

Cigar City Hunahpu's Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle from last year’s Hunahpu’s Day, an event organized by Cigar City to deliberately hype this beer, to the example of Three Floyds’ Dark Lord Day (it cannot be a coincidence, by the way, that the label states that ""Hunahpu was tricked by the Dark Lords of the Underworld"" - this is doubtlessly an ironic nod to Three Floyds...). Makes me very curious to find out if it is worth the hype. Opaque black colour (revealing itself to be a very dark mahogany in the end) with high degree of viscosity, under a crackling, moussy, deep brownish beige head, almost reddish brown initially, steadily receding but retaining a thin rim around the edges. Very powerful and very seductive aroma, utterly complex, refinedly sweet, roasted and subtly spiced, first almost a ’dame blanche’ of chocolate sauce made with cognac poured over home-made vanilla ice cream, coffee liqueur, marzipan, sweet dried chili peppers clearly there, burning pipe tobacco, milk chocolate bars and Belgian chocolates, vivid accent of cloves and (strongly) cinnamon rolls, kahlua, cappuccino, eucalyptus, refined bourbon-like alcohol, cashew nuts, allspice, candied dates and cherries, subtle touch of meat broth... The ’basic’ and dense malts, hops and alcohol bouquet releases ethereal, volatile and beguiling sweet spice accents whenever it feels like it. What a fascinating smell... I can sniff it for hours. I cannot wait to take a sip, and must conclude that the taste follows the aroma perfectly: the expected dense candied sweetness opens the palate and makes my mouth water, candied fruits, with an almost refreshingly minerally sourishness coming from carbonation, which may perhaps be a little bit stronger than usual for the style, but fits in perfectly here. A soft and beautiful vanilla sweetness is apparent already early on, even strongly so, but I love vanilla so this is, to say the least, a welcome surprise. Very creamy, velvety, viscous, oily mouthfeel and obviously very thick body, revealing an abyss of malts, very chocolatey, nutty and caramelly, with a strong mocha bitterness after the middle, lively and not just from roasted malts, but an actual, powdery and refined coffee beans flavour. Cinnamon comes up retronasally along with that wonderful vanilla flavour, and then the finish evolves, with a big and thick lingering malt and candy sweetness, cloying even, aided by peppery hop bitterishness and of course warming, but nonetheless very gentle, liqueur- or rhum-like alcohol; the cinnamon and coffee stick to the throat, as a mixture of sweet, bitter and umami flavours, but given the immense complexity of this beer, it is hard to tell which ingrediënt causes which aftertaste... The ancho and pasilla chili peppers, both rather mild varieties, are there, but provide just a subtle burning touch in the back of the mouth and throat, without disturbing the overall balance; I do get their earthy, smoky, sweetish, peppery flavour though, only adding further complexity. This brew is indeed hugely complex and consists of layer upon layer of flavour, absolutely divine. It takes a lot of concentration - and a large bottle - to try and grasp what is going on in this one, and this is again a reminder of what beer as a beverage is capable of. This kind of top quality beers of utmost complexity move me. Yes, this is clearly worth the hype; this is an awe-inspiring imperial stout, managing to respect all the qualities of its style and building upon them an own personality; I’m pretty sure I will recall this taste for the rest of my life. If it weren’t for the somewhat sticky, cloying effect in the back of the mouth and throat, I’d give it a perfect score, which would have made it my very best beer so far. For now: just one inch away from being perfect.  But then, considering my previous experiences with this brewery, I did have high hopes for this, admittedly.",0.0,0.9994

Superior aromas, I may say. My mouth is certainly delighted. The residual sugars are significant but skillfully shaken by a little alcohol heat, by a well-measured chili and by a precisely roasted cereal attack. So many elements intelligently placed to avoid too much sweet ferocity. On the palate, the liquid is very muscular. The texture is almost syrupy and even sometimes a little too heavy. In the second half of the tasting, the corners of my lips remain slightly stuck together. The fine and explosive bubbles seem to me to be shaped, at least, I think, to try to avoid any form of suffocation.

Anchorage A Deal With The Devil - Double Oaked 2017🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"2017 bottle drunk at the Referend First Anniversary line share, 12/2/17.
Deep mahogany-ruby, good clarity, with a dark beige head that shows moderate retention.
The nose shows rich oak tones that are not heavily toasted, or at least don't give the gross pina-colada character. Rather, spicy bourbon, rich wood and light rum raisin-like notes come through, with surprisingly soft esters, tons of cherry, vanilla, date, brown sugar and good acidity. Certainly some light alcohol, but it's not sharp, messy and it's pretty well-concealed for this abv. Extremely malty, yet it doesn't seem like it's going to be a sugary mess; the balance is definitely there. Furthermore, it's not chock full of specialty malt character, having a strong caramel-honey richness.
In the mouth it's ridiculously soft, creamy and malty, but shows good balance, as fruity, almost melanoidin-like acidity, strong wood and spicy liquor notes all balance the honey-caramel and brown sugar of the malts. The strong cherry-plum fruitiness is excellent and goes a long way to adding depth, while the barrel character adds an element as well, while not dominating the beer. Not syrupy in the least and doesn't feel underfermented. Warming alcohol dries the finish. Low but tight carbonation and no flaw.

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"In short: A big fat viscous chocolaty stout with an almost espresso-like coffee character.  Excellent (even if a bit overrated).

How: Fresh growler.  Sent to me by GodOfThunder, consumed within days of receiving it.  Thanks a lot Jay

The look: Pitch black body topped by a small brown head
 
In long: Nose is showing a roasted coffee beans over a chocolate cake.  Given the hype of the beer I expected a more explosive aroma. Body is thick and viscous as hell.  Somehow, the body felt more viscous than the base Marshall Zhukov, which is strange because usually I find that the coffee version of a big stout (example: Meph Addict vs Mephistopheles) makes for a dryer more roasted sensation.  Taste is pretty straightforward, a big fattening rich chocolate cake with fresh coffee beans.  I’m sure not familiar with the flavor of the much talked about Kopi Lowak coffee variety but to me the Final Push coffee character was a bit more espresso than with other well known high-quality coffee stouts (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.).  Of all the quality coffee stouts I’ve had I’d say that Final Push was the most chocolaty I’ve had.  Actually I don’t think the coffee outshines the chocolate or vice-versa.  Alcohol is a bit apparent but it is fitting for this dessert beer.  Also some green herbal notes.  Carbonation was relatively smooth, I would have preferred a more active carbonation to increase drinkability but maybe it is because it was a growler consumed a week after it was filled.  So despite my long rambling, all I can really say about this beer is that it is a rich chocolate cake and coffee with some alcohol warmth and light green herbal notes.  Even after drinking a full growler I really cannot add anything.  It is   a straightforward but highly enjoyable sipper.  In a blind tasting I don’t think it would score higher than the less hyped widely available quality coffee stouts out there (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.) but it remains an excellent example of the style.  And in case you drank the beer but don’t know why the beer is named “Final Push”… well, you don’t want to know, just like you don’t want to know if your mother ever kissed your goodnight after giving your father a blowjob.",0.06395294793910793,0.9931

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Tap at the BA Hunahpu release 9/24/11. Thanks to drowland for saving me a pour of this rarity. You are the man!

Pour is typical Zhukov, an ink black SRM that produces a Martian red head looking extremely similar to used motor oil. Bubbles and all. Lots of glass staining but not a lot of head retention and lacing. Nose is quite nice. I’m not the biggest coffee fan, but can appreciate having hazelnut, vanilla, cinnamon apples, and cocoa powder in the nose in lieu of near DMS like qualities and sharp, gritty roast. Rich and soft in the nose thankfully. For taste, I still think the palate is what shines above taste. Palate is rich and oily. Extremely thick but no cloying sugars like you would expect given the staining. Instead, the coffee does pack decent bitterness (no astringency) but there is still such a hefty dose of coffee acidity creating a tart lemon profile in the back end. Certainly yummy, but someone may see this as simply extremely thick coffee rather than imperial stout. Could use more bitterness and could work on the appearance department.

Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Thanks to ______, I had an opportunity to try this at the 2nd Pgh Tasting on the 2nd. I’m not telling you who gave me a glass from the screw top bottle because I don’t want him to get hatemail because of me!  Either way, I was really glad to have the chance to rate a beer that floridians consider one of the best, heheh. First off, my immature palate is not refined enough to be allowed to rate such a refined(?) big beer, so sue me. If you are a lover of CC then take my number and subtract it from 5 and get your real rating. From the beginning I knew this was going to be something else; weird looking screw top squatty bottle with a lable that had hand written FINAL PUSH on it. Pouring into the glass it looks like used 50W shovelhead motor oil. Coating the glass it seems to be staining it dark brown. Smell? Atttack of coffee on the olfactory. Did I say it smells like big coffee espresso? Sorry, I just recovered after hitting my head on the wall behind me. No head. Initially, all I tste in this stuff is big black triple espresso cold. Perhaps there is some alky in there but the flavor is so overwhelming coffee I can’t stand it; over the top and way too much personality for this mockery of a beer. I don’t know how stuff like this can be considered beer. OK, after my taste buds recover I do taste come tobacco and pepper in there, perhaps. From beginning to end this is nothing new in the coffee stout scene. Yes, special, perhaps but there are so many other beers out there with these characteristics; over the top roto-tilling burnt coffee and a little alky. Finish reminds me of grampa’s cold espresso with whiskey in it. Big thanks to the guy, you know who you are, that gave this too me to rate. I am very fortunate to have had the chance to taste this.

aroma is unlike any beer i’ve ever experienced. absolutely stunning with the most intense, rich, world class espresso, charred french roast, fruity, freshly harvested coffee beans, and a touch of spiced, mexican blend and backed by elegant, pure dark chocolate, toasted hazelnuts, and hints of vanilla with subtle notes of cinnamon and topsoil as it warms in my CCB snifter. i literally spent 10 minutes savoring the aroma before taking a sip! so long, in fact, LJ started laughing at me and she’s seen me rate hundreds of beers before this one. flavor is almost indescribable. just on a completely different level than mere mortal imperial coffee stouts with a massive onslaught of rich espresso, freshly roasted $100/lb coffee, and bitter, slightly fruity, spent grinds with a sublime balance offerred by rich, semi-sweet fudge, vanilla, and subtle molasses with hints of fresh cinnamon, dark fruits, and cigar ash on the back end. palate is nothing short of perfect. i mean, this ""shit"" drinks like a damn frappacino with a silky, slick texture, perfect carbonation, and the most intense, chocolate, roasted coffee finish i’ve ever experienced. overall, truly a sublime beer. no way i can rate this any less that a perfect 5 as it’s definitely one of the absolute best beers i’ve ever tasted.",0.1778216897897548,0.9978

Zhukov is already in itself a complex imp stout.

What makes Final Push beyond the pun of the name of the beer is the unique character that this coffee gives.

bittersweet chocolate. Very light carbonation which def doesn’t

Medium mouthfeel and a chalky finish. Little to no hop character.",0.0,0.877

The mouthfeel is great, but it’s a bit one dimensional.",0.0,0.8762
Cigar City Final Push Imperial Stout🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Mini growler. Inky black pour yields a a scant dark khaki head. A gentile swirl leaves an oily stain on the side of my glass. High grade coffee, bittersweet Belgian chocolate, dark fudge, a hint of smoke and ash initially on the nose. Molasses, maybe a touch of soy. The 11% is hardly noticeable at all. The coffee doesn’t overpower the base beer at all... which is nice. Flavor is fairly coffee-dominant, but you can tell this is high grade shit (pun intended). Slightly ashy. Bitter chocolate. The roast level of the malt and the coffee are damn near perfect... almost to the point of being astringent, but never crossing that line. As on the nose, the alcohol is hidden expertly. Leaning toward full bodied. Slick, rich texture with a bitter, roasty, coffee laden finish. I’m not a fan of coffee beers, but this one is really well done. Thanks",0.12499999999999997,-0.5981

The flavors follow suit and are just as rich and decadent. The freshly roasted coffee comes through in the flavor first and perfectly balances the dark chocolate malt. Sweet milk chocolate and cream round out the flavor profile. The coffee is really well integrated without being overly roasted at all.

I just enjoyed a couple pints of Zhukov’s Final  Push at the Order of the Red Banner dinner 2013. Better than I expected and I expected a lot. Just a deep, black, vanilla, charred, evil, espresso, acrid smoke, tobacco. So many great things about this beer... even better than the first time I tried this one, back in 2010. Greatest coffee beer ever!


Original Rating 

Nitro… RBWG ‘10… This beer rocks!… Tar black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, dark brown head. Fantastic retention. The pungent, acrid aroma must weigh in at about 800 lbs. Huge, acidic, earthy, espresso and dark chocolate aroma. Smells more like espresso than espresso. Lesser notes of maduro tobacco and blackstrap molasses. Almost fecal… in a good way, much like a funky-as-hell, barnyard-ish, Belgian lambic’s bouquet can be very appealing.  Full-bodied and velvety with pillow-soft carbonation. Big, bold, acrid espresso and black malt flavor. Malt sweetness is countered by carbonous espresso and charcoal bitterness. Undertones of pouch tobacco, cocoa nibs and blackstrap molasses. Lingering mocha finish.

I took a whiff and got some of the richest, most enticing coffee notes I’ve ever smelled (on coffee or beer). The weasels did a bang-up job on this batch. The appearance was definitely trade-mark zhukov: viscous, heavy, dense and darker than a  black steer’s tuckus on a moonless prairie night. 
The taste is phenomenal: bitter chocolate, COFFEE, some very subtle licorice, light vanilla. You immediately notice the staple dark amber coating on your glass after you take the first sip. Amazing beer! The back palate lingers with some notes of coffee and dark fruit.

Flavors follow right in line, as rich and luscious as the nose hints it might be.  The softly bitter coffee roast is less earthy than I expected, very clean actually, and it serves as the perfect counterpoint to the light sweetness of the dark chocolate malt base.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"The legendary special blend made in 1998 for the fiftieth anniversary of the Drie Fonteinen blendery, released in 2000 as a one-off, and the first to bear Felix De Boeck's ""Nightlights"" (a Flemish 1977 painting) on its label, later reused on the Oude Geuze Vintage. Never thought I would ever get the chance to taste this legend, but Akkurat had a few bottles left apparently and I was more than happy to pay the 1295 SEK they charged per bottle - considering the skyrocketing prices whales like this generate on the black market, it seemed proportionally very reasonable. Fun to see how nervous the waiter was when he had to open the bottle, quite a solemn moment really. And after twenty years, this geuze was still very much alive: some gushing was apparently inevitable but with minimal loss (not more than, say, 5 SEK or so…). Thick and very frothy, off-white, lightly lacing and slowly opening but largely stable head on a misty straw blonde robe with warm peachy tinge and lively sparkling - looking like a bottle of no more than a year old. Ancient damp cellar and decades old wine from said cellar cover the original profile like an ornamental blanket, a profile consisting of ripe peaches, sour apple, oxidized white wine, haystack, very old dry sherry, moldy lemon peel, moist jute cloth, green plum peel, sour grapes, old artisanal cider, barnyard, faint hint of chlorine - all the fine elements I am looking for in a top quality 'oude' geuze. Softly and complexely estery onset, wryness of grape and plum peel soaked in gooseberry and crabapple sourness with a softer pear- and peach-like edge, yet nowhere descending into a harshly burning acidity and enlivened by a perfectly measured, cava-like sparkling on the tongue. A soft, bready 'soil' carries the esters onwards with pear and gooseberry remaining the most prominent impressions, towards a 'brut', highly complex, dense but still refreshing finish in which the musty cellar and very old wine notes are accompanied by hayish and leathery Brettanomyces effects on top and wet wood tannins below, the latter quite long-stretched and eventually bittered by a dim, structurally essential and perfectly positioned, very late hop bitter touch. The tartness carries on, adorned by the woody effects and the noble effects of elegant aging. I have held this producer in very high esteem ever since I first put a Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze to my lips a couple of decades ago, but this absolute masterpiece of a geuze was a real honour to taste, all the more so because age has not demolished its basic structure: on the contrary, the ancient wine and musty cellar merely oversee the funky, estery complexity with great care and nobility. Underneath these charming old age aspects still lies a perfectly refreshing, perfectly solid, complex and bright geuze, internally untouched by age, like the roguishly twinkling blue eyes of a weather-beaten old man's face still betraying his soul's eternal youth.

I believe it was around 50F temp when served.



A - First pour was a burnt dark orange / gold appearance. The cork had a HUGE pop exploding but not gushing. GREAT SIGN! First pour was a 5 finger solid white huge bubbly head. Subsequent pours got more cloudy obviously. Dregs were dark brown w/ hints of red.



S - Nose is a mix of blue cheese, cardboard basement musk and funk with a lot of wood, mold and more cheese the 3F funk with lemon nose is there but super subdued. Reminds of the same funky moldy basement funk that I got from Blauw.



T - a know what....taste is pretty freaking awesome. Yes a lot of cardboard and shoe polish. A lot of leather and wood and moldy grapes. But it’s incredibly tart and well done. Lots of lemon, cloth aged old cheddar and funk classic 3 F. Tart overall. 



M - Bursting classic 3F mouthfeel. Bubbly, filling and huge.

Aroma is nice and complex with an amazing earthiness and herbal note to it. Light citric acidity to compliment the beer. Musty hay and barnyard notes to compliment. Almost no acetic note. Herbal character is a touch minty. 
Pours a fairly clear pale golden color with a fairly big, light pillowy head that recedes until it is just a film along the top and edges. The film persists for quite some time. 
Flavor has a bit more citrus than the aroma and has a touch less barnyard character. Flavor still has quite a bit of that earthy, herbal note. Really pleasant balance of acidity and funk. The moderate acidic note is clean and citrusy while very smooth and not in your face. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Such a nice silkiness to this beer which is shocking for an acidic beer. 
Overall an amazingly complex beer with so much nice earthy notes, barnyard notes, some hay and really light, pleasant acidity.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"2 x 3 oz pour from a bottle @ The Festival (Portland). When I drank it, I thought it was regular 1998 Oude Gueuze, but I was confirmed after that it was the 50th anniversary. My oldest lambic so far. Hazy golden/orange with a small to medium white head and little lacing. Aroma is so enticing with barnyard, green apple, musty notes, light banana(?), funk, horse blanket and fruity notes. Taste is slightly sweet and moderately funky with barnyard, horse blanket, green apple, musty notes, fruits, earthy notes and light lemony presence. Mouthfeel is dry. Still well carbonated. I’m really impressed by how good and multi-layered this gueuze is, even after 15 years. This is amazingly complex, but what is even more impressive is how well balanced this Gueuze is. That would be a perfect everyday gueuze. Incredibly drinkable. Not far behind J&J Blauw (and on par with Lente) for my top gueuze (and top beer) ever!

The flavor brings abundant minty notes, followed by herbal, floral, and earth. The beer is smooth, with lingering funk and mint notes.

Pours a clear golden color with a bit of a tawny hue to the background. The head is white and small, falling somewhat quickly and leaving behind some sparse lacing as it lays down in a thin collar.

The nose brings some heavy earth and funk with lightly-oxidized malt. Some interesting light herbal characteristics in the background that I’ve never gotten from a Drie Fonteinen gueuze before.

The flavor is much more complex and integrated, with the funk, earth, and light herbal character headed to the next level. Average flavor duration with light acidity and moderate funk through the finish.

The body is medium and slightly-chewy with light carbonation. Really great feel and complexity.

We were all ready with glasses for the rush, so it was a pleasant surprise when this beer opened with a healthy pop and no explosion. Pour is a golden orangey straw with a fluffy but not quite rocky white head that fades to half a finger. Aroma is classic farmyard brett-dominated, with musty floral and vitamin notes. Taste is much more balanced than expected -- no bitterness, but incredibly dry. Tart cherry and citrus flavors initially dominate, and as it warms it becomes more floral/grassy and distinctly mineral. Carbonation is high but not overpowering, and mouthfeel is surprisingly rich. Zero astringency.



I can’t get over how smooth and mild this is, especially in comparison to some of the other great 3F vintages (2002, 1999). So easy to drink, and so hard to get. A real treat.",0.07669649888473704,0.9759

Re-rate I have to change my original rating of 3.9.  I shared a bottle received from a friend whose cellar conditions cannot be questioned.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Heavy yellow gold with the standard rocky, spidery white head from aged Drie Fonteinen, reduces to a thick ring. Nose is more Drie Fonteinen than anything I’ve smelled before. It shows all the standard excellence, lactic sourness complimented perfectly by the cobweb and horse qualities, so incredibly dusty, leather, and some hay fold out in waves, lightest touches of salt and rind that remind of Blauw. Then an herbal mint emerges, almost ouzo-like, adding a lightly balanced sweetness. Yeah, that’s just the nose. The flavor is a small step down, still all the usual characteristics as mentioned above, very soft and subtle, integration sublime. Wheaty and sweet, even caramel-heavy compared to Blauw, more dusty and complex, less singularly citric than Millennium. It’s not as crazy as Blauw once was, but I prefer the complexity, refinement, and cobweb brilliance. Tried two bottles on a trip where we sampled 60+ lambics, all the classics included.

Earthy, musty aroma that isn’t overly funky with barrel/wood character as well as some barnyard/horsey notes, crisp light fruit and subtle citrus.

Medium bodied with a soft, earthy funkiness that isn’t harsh, solvent-like or overpowering allowing the citrus notes and vinegary acetic acids to shine through.

This beer has aged very gracefully, retaining it’s puckering, funky character while remaining clean and quaffable.

The look: Cloudy orange body topped by a long-lasting small off-white head

In long: Intense nose (and I mean INTENSE) of old attic, barnyard and dusty funk.  Taste is as complex as the beer is easy to drink.  Very rustic, moderately funky, dry wood, some tropical fruits, barnyard, brett, dusty attic.  Very dry beer.  Far from the intense sourness of a Cantillon or other Gueuze sippers, this beer is actually only moderately sour and moderately acidic (relative to the style).  Carbonation was very lively and the body was full, fluffy and lively.  I like to say that I drank full bottles by myself of many rare lambics and concluded that they are overrated because of rarity (50N-4, Selection Lambic, Millenium, Crianza, Don Quijote, others…) and they do not measure up to a regular Cantillon Gueuze/Gambrinus or Hanssens Geuze/Kriek.  I like to go against the grain, makes me feel “cool” and immune to the hype.  But here I’ve got to go with the hype.  3F 50th Anniversary is simply the best Gueuze I’ve ever had.  And unlike most other lambics, this is actually one that I could honestly drink in large quantities on a regular basis.  Given the age of the bottle I wouldn’t bet on another bottle being as exquisite as this one I’m rating.  I’m keeping the empty bottle.

The aroma, while initially restrained, opens up as the beer breathes, showing a mild, nutty, cheesy funk, horseblanket, matzoh, and brine. Bright carbonation in the body with a surprisingly delicate acidity. The beer in general is amazingly reminiscent of quality champagne, just a bit more acidic. Long, horsey, hay-like finish. Zero astringency and bitterness. This is getting better and better as it warms. Truly world class, and puts the Millennium Gueuze to shame.

Moderate white foamy head is slow to recede, never fully doing so. Lacing is thick and intricately webbed and fully covering, to the last sip. Quite vibrant for a beer of this age. A gently caressing nose is very expressive, even in its mellowed state. Notes of must and dust peel back slowly to reveal a blend of citrus fruits, sour barnyard, wheat, minerals, tart cherries, apples and ascorbic acid(chewable vitamin C), grassy notes and a full-on assault of yeast. What an experience. Flavor is mildly acidic and heavily fruity. Sweetness is just apparent enough to provide a sense of balance. Bitterness sets in late and with a full coating near the finish. Medium to medium-full bodied mouthfeel, zesty and refined at once. The palate is perfectly wrought, an intense maze of carbonation and yeasty particulates, with a dab of lemon juice acidity for good measure. Spicy and warming, the swallow leads to a finish of neverending complexity, lengthy and sublime. Light bitterness counterbalances a marauding sweetness that builds with each sip. An absolute knockout, as per the usual with this most graceful brewery.",0.06108472217815261,0.9775

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Many many thanks goes out towards Clark for opening a bottle of this, shame you left the other bottle at O’Briens. I don’t feel so bad about leaving my 2004 Speedway behind now. Once again Clark’s review is much more detailed that mine but I will add my two cents to a rating of this brew:  Poured surprisingly clean and was topped by a big foamy white head and had excellent strings of lace work upon the glass. The nose detected lots of barnyard and brett yeast character along with fleeting vapors of floral meadows and lemongrass. There was also a strange corky and steel nature to the nose that shows some damage in aging.  The flavors are very rustic and farmyard up front with some lingering acidic fruit. I too found the metallic finish but unlike Clark, Chris and Mike (sorry guys you are wrong) I did not seem to mind it as much as my rating proves. The mouth feel is soft yet does have a crisp around the edge bite to keep things interesting. I loved this beer and would truly freak out for another chance to try it.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Bottle shared at O’Briens on 3/23/07.  I also bought one to go, but left it at O’Briens.  There goes $45.  Yay for being an idiot….
Nice to see this available at a beer bar in the States.  At least now I can hold on to the bottle I do have in my cellar.  Though I’m not so sure how long I plan on holding it, after having tried this bottle.  This particular bottle had a distinct metallic flavor, not sharp and poignant, but rather sweeping in towards the end and blanketing the palate with soft metal notes.  Hmm, that makes little sense, but at the time, Chris and I were better able to describe it.  Suffice to say, the metallic notes definitely cut in to the experience in a negative way.
Not that I plan on scoring this beer based on this bottle.  No, that would be silly.  A bottle the next day and pretty much every review on this site mentions nothing of metal.  Obviously just an off or mishandled bottle.
The aroma was rather impressive, nonetheless, and I didnt note the metal there.  Very fruity, with tons of soft brett suggestions, none of the stronger, sharper lactic or pedio (or less of it, anyways) of the Cantillon, De Cam and newer 3F beers.  And that’s fine, it’s still got a lovely funkiness to it, very musty, rustic and lightly sweaty, with a vibrancy that defies its age.  Nice strength of aroma as well, with what lactobacillus notes there are, adding a little snap to it.
So back to the flavor, it’s obvious this is made from a very similar stock as the 1999 vintage.  Fruity, very malt apparent (not sweetness, of course, but with a soft, well-malted texture) and highly bretty.  Again, I prefer the stronger, more aggressive nature of the newer 3F gueuzes and Cantillon, as this one remains rather light and more ""Belgian brett golden ale influenced"" if you will.
Great stuff, but I’d be hard pressed to believe that even a bottle in great condition would be radically different from the 1999-2001 3F gueuzes.  Appearance/mouthfeel/texture/carbonation are all perfectly to-style.  No alcohol noted, of course.",0.0,0.9931

The nose on this is one of the most complex I’ve experienced in some time.  The body is light and crisp with a happy, lively effervescence that really awakens the tongue.  When sampling, one of the first things that jumps out at me is a light, fruity sweetness.  The sweetness is more perceptible than in most examples, but quickly morphs into a stunning, bracing example of funky, earthy acidity.  The acidity is greeted by a surprisingly strong and slightly shocking bitterness.  Mostly citrus zest with a hint of pine and a lot of shock.  Definitely more bitterness than I remember in most Geuze.  This is just one fantastic beer.  The complexity is robust and damn near profound.  As the beer warms, it metamorphisizes into a smoother example of itself, showing a bit more fruitiness and allowing the funky acidity to permeate its environs.

750ml bottle, vintage 11/1998

Consumed at  Delirium Cafe, Brussels, May 2006 (8 years cellared)
 Cloudy yellow and warm orange colored body.  First taste is semi-musty oranges and warm fruit.  Thick, musty, old, over-ripe fruits dominate this gueze, admittedly not one of my favorite gueze aspects.  Old, tinny, almost ""bloody"" nose of oranges.  The sourness is fresh and light, thankfully, and almost creamy at times.  Moderately thick texture.  Very good, less brash than most, most likely due to age, but I can’t mark this up anymore due to the old fruit flavors which I find mildly unpleasent.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Over a month ago, during my trip to Amsterdam I had the chance of visiting De Bierkoning, a store whose praiseful reputation is genuinely well founded. After gaping at the enormous selection found upstairs, I proceeded to the cramped lambic cellar where two gems caught my eye. On the bottommost shelf were two small sets of dusty bottles whose green glass still emitted a slight twinkle among the wrinkles of time. I grasped one by its neck and gently dusted off the label feeling like an archeologist in an ancient Egyptian tomb. ""1998"". Ah! What a wonderful year marked by France’s win in the World Cup and as I was about to discover, the creation of an outstanding brew. 




Back in Paris, the pour in my Rochefort glass produced an obfuscated crepuscular melon color with no visible carbonation. The head, of an off-white hue, was dynamic, its bubbles of varying sizes creating wondrous patterns. Raspberries emerged at the pop of the cork, filling the nose with a delectable fragrance. Fruits of all kinds flood the aroma, releasing apple, sour cherries, pineapple, passion fruit and with warming some wild strawberries. The incredible complexity is further augmented by the odors of Champagne, brown sugar, soap, vanilla, cider, rose and mint. An exceptional concoction that subtly cools the nasal cavity much like freshly crushed mint. On the tongue apricot dominates initially while sweet peaches deliberately appear with time. A complex Champagne flavor is emphasized while the liquid is still cool but spearmint is quickly revealed along with a citrussy combination of unsweetened grapefruit and lemon that lingers after the swallow. The carbonation is well preserved and feels surprisingly tingling as it complements the body perfectly before flowing into a velvety finish on the back of the tongue. One might compare the aftertaste to New Belgium’s La Folie, though the sourness is further accompanied by fruits, notably apricot.

3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze 1998 (50th Anniversary)🇧🇪Lambic - Gueuze,"Many thanks Luc and Olivier!!!



The Lure:
Wild hay and straw dance to the cadence of the brettanomyces storm. Much funkier than the regular Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze. 



The Festivities:
Diplomatic sourness supports the big-bubbled carbonation and the savage yet intelligent funkiness. Barnyard humidity prevails and imposes itself onto the hay and warped wood. Everything (tartness, dryness, wild yeastiness, citrus flavors) is nicely blended to a medium intensity, yet is enlivened by an inner whirlwind which makes it present a different façade every sip or so.



Transcendence:
Opening up the barn after a few days away.

Swirl of the glass yields lemon, oak, and airy elements. Creamy with a well-rounded softness. Initially firm with musty oak and a brett-laced blast of lactic acidity and vinegar. Soft bodied, yet remarkably brisk at the same time, with a staunch foundation of crushed minerals. Rich toasty oakiness thwarts much of the irony tartness, while the brett virtually fades into a mere afterthought. Vague sparkle of perfume and husky Pils malt. Less tongue-grippingly tart, though, showing trace peach acidity and tannins, which are shortened by the body’s softness. Ends woodily firm and dry, but insistently soft and seemingly low-attenuated, with a muted mix of white grapes and honeyed malt. It’s undoubtedly on the oaky end of the Lambic spectrum, which you gotta love, but it needs a lengthier malt character and certainly more influence from the acidity and brett, to be flawless.",0.1259881576697424,0.9485

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"I want to start off by saying thank you to the generous BA who shared this with a few of us last night.  I definitely thought trying this one was beyond my reach.  ""We are but mere mortals in the presence of M.""  Indeed.

Pours extremely dark for a barleywine, dark mahogany brown, with a small beige head.  It looks almost like a Belgian dark in color, almost black.

Aroma is outstanding and has clearly held up to the years in the bottle.  It’s a good bit fruiter than I was expecting, certainly more than the typical barleywine.  Lots of raisins and plums mixed with chocolate and caramel.  The oak is present with some light tannins, leather and booze.

The taste just doesn’t live up to the aroma though it’s still extremely good.  This is clearly where the age is beginning to catch up to M, with hints of oxidation creeping in.  The booze soaked dark fruits are in the forefront, but with a chocolate-covered character to the whole thing.  The finish is a mixture of port, oak and the oxidized notes.

The mouthfeel is creamy, smooth, and softly carbonated.  Hides the alcohol exceptionally well
.
This is one of the more complex barleywines I’ve ever had and the nose really stands up to anything I’ve ever smelled in the style.  I have to imagine that this would have been one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted if I had it 2-3 years ago.  As it is, I feel lucky to have been able to try it and it has held up much better than could be expected.",0.0,0.9937
Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Wow...bottle shared by scraff. Thanks a lot, Scott!

The beer appears a dark, chestnut brown color and displays a small, oily, beige head. Only sparse lacing is left behind as well as an oily, filmy layer that coats the snifter.

The aroma shows a bit of age and a myriad of scents, to include figs, raisins, plums, oak, booze, maple, brandy, toffee, caramels.

The beer is rich and luxurious, yet light on the palate somehow. Smooth and velvety, a silky feel. The flavor resembles a fine tawny port or sherry. Dark fruits coated with brown sugar. A delicate sweetness is present throughout. A light, warming booze presence, but unobtrusive. This beer goes down effortlessly. What an experience.",0.07453559924999298,0.8268
Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Thanks Mike for bringing this epic bottle. Another bottle I never thought I’d have the honor of trying, thank the lord for Epic Tres! Pours a dark brown with some reddish hues when held to the light. Good carbonation on the pour. Nose opens up with honey and caramel, then moves onto more caramel, dark fruit, light booziness, cocoa, and oak. Tastes slightly oxidized, but it’s still a phenomenal barleywine. Caramel, honey, chocolate, malt, dark fruit, some light brown sugar, and molasses. Exceptionally smooth, not really boozy at all, low carbonation, and a long finish. Not just a product of hype, M is a real damn good beer. While it may be slightly past it’s peak, it is still one of the best barleywines I’ve ever had. Thanks again Mike.",0.0,0.9365
Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Huge, huge thanks to Scott for opening this bottle and giving me the opportunity to try some.  Served in a Midnight Sun goblet.  Pours a very dark brown with a thin light tan head that recedes fairly-quickly, leaving behind a few spots of lacing as it falls to a thin collar.  The nose has loads of dark fruits with plum and raisin being prominent.  The background is a bit of caramel and toffee with very mild esters.  Some barrel character is there, though it’s in the background.  The flavor adds in a touch of port character along with a very mild oak and vanilla presence.  Not the most complex that I’ve had, but quite good.  Body is medium with low carbonation and a slight viscosity.  Smooth with no noticeable alcohol.  Overall, a very delicious beer that I would have at any time.  However, at this point, I’d say that things like King Henry and perhaps Kuhnhenn BB4D are equal or better.

Looks black or very dark brown from a distance, but when held to light has some very dark red colors to it.  Excellent clarity on the beer.

Aroma jumps out of the glass with burnt sugar, molasses, sour cherries, mint, rum, bourbon, oak, plum, raisins, and Christmas cookies.  Intense and complex smell, but everything smells so delicious.

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle.  Rich chocolate brown, oak hued pour producing a brimming crown of tan that gathers in a ring around the edge.  Sweet, refined aroma of bourbon, caramel and candi sugar, citrus, port wine, oak, and raisin.  Smooth, glimmering polish and never a moment of overindulgence or reckless decadence; most notable is the cleanness and calmness of it.  Raspberries and pomegranate lend a bit of zingy tartness along an alcohol hit back end.  Spirit touched throughout, but more as a silky ribbon of bourbon presence than a sudden iron fisted punch. 


Flavor is monstrously rich and juicy; streamlined balance.  Dates, red licorice, prunes, belgian chocolate, mousse, caramel.  Lush, sensual, contemplative complexity that seems so soft and silky.  It isn’t a monstrous, confronting sweetness but more a clean, rich cavendish tobacco, rustic campfire dessert sweetness.  Full, delicate oak and bourbon tanginess and fleshy, rich red fruits sitting in a wet oatmeal cookie dough.  Sugar everywhere and all with a polished dark edge.



Brilliantly reserved full palate.  Balanced, syrupy body is firm but never imposing; it seems to taper off into a reticent tannic feel briefly, rather than diving headlong into the ostentatious decadence it seems bound toward, before settling on a calm, creamy maple  texture.  The restraint and balanced execution at that point are nothing short of stunning.  Pungent date flavor finishes.



Having sunk slowly into a soil of rich character and otherworldly sweetness, the potential for this example still seems excitingly bottomless, although this gorgeous point of settled complexity could probably be considered somewhere within its peak.  Thanks Tim!",0.237825747077247,0.9967

But man, once it warmed up it went to another level. Vinous without being overpowering, and toffee notes that suggest an English barleywine or old ale but with a multi-leveled texture that comes courtesy of some bright fruits, hops, and the aforementioned wine qualities. Very full and silky mouthfeel, with tobacco and molasses emerging strongly, ending up like a top-notch port. So many different qualities in a beer that goes to so many different places, all while retaining a singular and unique identity of its own. Amazing. Thanks, Tom!!!",0.0,0.9888

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"A long time coming for this guy.  A highlight of the 4/12 tasting at J’s pad - go figure, our numbers line up.  Big shout out to Tim - thanks man for making this happen. 

Poured quite dark w/ minimal head dissipating into tiny bubbles.  Nose was hovering around sweet malts, raisins, candi sugar, and deeply bourbon soaked wood.  Subtle but arrogant.  Flavor was damn sweet up front with a heavy dose or raisin, sugars, prunes, berries, toffee, wood, tobacco, brown sugar, smoky burnt malt behind the upfront sweetness - rounded by a port like elegance.  The palate and body on this beer is a slice of heaven...rich, smooth, cocky, mellow, and pissed off all at once.  It is evident the years of aging have melded, mellowed, and blended these flavors into a mouth coating blanket like palate - the body of this beer are in a dream like state.  The belgian yeast strains also shine in the background - you can feel their influence in how the body and flavors differ from a cut throat, balls deep american style b-wine.  The bourbon presence plays a mentor type role here - rather than a smothering and flavor raping son of a bitch - I dig that here.  This is and was a work of art....I can only wonder how it will continue to develop - as for now, it sure is drinking greatly.",0.056980288229818966,-0.6187
Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"A major thanks to jarspag for cracking open this huge rarity; I never thought we would ever get to try this when I first heard of it months and months ago. Very very dark for a barley wine, nearly black in the center with lighter maroon edges. Fading beige head and spotty lacing. Smells delicious! Sweet, caramelized Belgian candy sugar with raisin and plum, oak wood and loads of toffee. Some earthy leather tones and bourbon fruitcake underneath. Intriguing Belgian influence in the flavor, fruity and sweet. The candy sugar comes out more in the flavor with notes of port wine, black grape and raisin cinnamon bread. The +/-3 years of age show nicely, as the flavors are very mellowed and well-blended. A hint of stingy oxidation is noticeable. Extremely smooth palate with a lasting flavor of sugary bourbon and oak. Overall the bourbon barrel is more subtle than expected, and the Belgian yeast strains give it a unique and complex aspect. Excellent!",0.0,0.9559

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Pours dark brown and nearly opaque, with traces of ruby in the hips of the tulip glass.
A tan head of humble proportions struggled to reveal itself, with a stretch of a pour.
The quarter-inch of foam dissapated quickly, leaving a partial coverage at best.
Susequent swirls of the glass rose up continued frothing easily.
Remarkable in the nose. Heavily laced with thick malt, dried figs, charred oak, bourbon, and port. 
Layers of richness continue with shades of leather, sherry, dark rum, toffee, and vanilla.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Quite sticky and somewhat syrupy.
The pallet is rich and decadent. 
Caramelized sugars, chewy malt, vineous port, and burnt chocolate bits.
Beneath the massive malt bill and unfermentables lies a cherry-like oxidation and bourbon.
Bitterness and any hopping is negligable, and the vineous nature leans the brew into an ""Old ale"" stance.
Finishes sweetish with lingering dark rum, port, smoked leather, and caramlized brown sugar.

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Deep, roasty brown colors with some ruddy cherry hues and a thin layer of desperatly clinging, creamy beige head.  Distinctly Belgian malt character in the nose - a plethora of raisins, molasses, fleshy prunes, and a hint of cinnimon spice.  Some notes of caramel and vanilla toffee are also present in the bouquet, adding a  thick dessert-like quality to the spicy belgian malt concoction that rests beneath the nose.  Fantastic full-bodied mouthfeel with a shimmering carbonation that lightens up the weight of the palate, making it full bodied without getting syrupy.  Easily one of the best mouthfeels I have ever experienced.  Lots of deep caramelly raisin characters with loads of prune and molasses-soaked organic brown sugar.  Some sticky fired cured Virginia tobacco gives it a unique woody character.  So many wonderful things are going on here its difficult to describe with words, but there really is no need as this one is a truly memorable experience.  A well caramelized british raisin pudding topped with a slice of port soaked dried pineapple.  Warming finish, but without any harsh edges.

Exquisitely toasted maltiness reaches the nose and penetrated the mind with maple richness and pancakes succulence. Rich, but not too aggressive. It is immensely sweet, but kinda fitting. The bourbon oakiness mostly appears in mouth, otherwise the beer is an opus to malt. Considerable grape character evolves on the palate toward blackberries, while vanilla laden minty flavours corroborate the initial brown chocolate sweet barrel aspirations. Grenadine syrup eventually joins the race to caramilk land. Building layers of fun to decorticate malt elements that ensures its legend to stay well alive among beer geeks.

The flavour was quite sweet as well, lots of brown sugar again, candied fruits, dark cherries, chocolate malt and caramel.  Some minor alcohol present, thick mouthfeel, medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes with a lingering light bitterness, slightly dry.

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,Very dark brown with a red hue and a creamy thin walnut colored head. Sweet brown sugar and dark caramel with some leather and a hint of alcohol. Very sweet but balanced by the complex nutty malt musky bourbon flavors and a lick of tartness. Luxurious body. I think the commercial description is right on and the beer lives up to it. I hauled six bottles 20 miles into the Alaskan bush on a canoe trip which were greatly appreciated by the locals I was with.

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Thanks to mjames to sharing this. I struggled on whether to even rate this, as I never did quite get a handle on it. I do know that the aroma was like a good scotch, and that went further into the flavor, with hints of a good pipe tobacco. Very smooth for 11.6%, had so much going on in the flavor that I couldn’t ever really wrap my palate around much. There was a strange flavor that I can’t begin to describe, that while not awful, kept this from being perfect. Close to being the most complex thing I have ever tasted.",0.0,0.9396

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Blackened ruby. Attractive gray-tan foam disperses to form a tightly packed fringe. Lace dots the glass. Splendid nose of port, tobacco, mashed prunes, and fruitcake. Touch of wood and salty bourbon. Lush, pillow soft carbonation. Superbly conditioned. Mild dried plum tartness caresses the jet-puffed thickset malt structure. Tardy, but sufficient, emergence of tannins and dainty yeast fruitiness pierce the viscid consistency. Magically, the alcohol is never a factor, even as it reaches room temp. Artfully placed crystallized sugar grittiness reinforces the fluffy malt backbone. Gains more jammy succulence as it breathes. Next-to-nil phenolics fail to complement the sweetness, but the redeeming aridness more than compensates. Finishes juicy with a kiss of fruitcake infused with grapey acidity as a powdery brush of oaky dryness skims the palate and stabilizes the sweetness. Hops seal the finish by lending a lasting breath of fruitiness. Feels downright wonderful on the mouth, aroma and flavors are quite cohesive, alcohol is virtually imperceptible, and the bourbon shows plenty enough restraint to allow the complex nuances to come forward.

Midnight Sun M🇺🇸Barley Wine / Wheat Wine / Rye Wine,"Body is deep brown, very close to pitch black but also with some walnut color near the top.  The head is regular sized with brown sugar colored bubbles.  First scent of the nose is vanilla beans, brown sugar, perhaps some strange (can’t put a finger on it) meaty/soy sauce/worcestershire sauce.  Sweet bourbon dates, definitely a strong raisin presence, and a chemical-alcohol tinge of black, thick (dare I say triple bock?) steak marinade.  10 minutes later when this sucker has warmed the bourbon just opens up so well... resiny, sour, woody and everything else.  Really wonderful aroma developed at a warmer temperature for this one.  The oak is bolder as well, with that definitive oak wood scent that you can smell through the bourbon, much like you can smell through any other fluid that may have sat in an oak barrel before it being used for brewing.  First up front on the lips it’s tingly and sweet, the Belgian yeast is noted easily, and there’s a pleasant buzz or numbing on the tongue from the bourbon and slightly peppy bite of wood. Seems the bourbon and wood are light flavors overall, which is really appreciated.  The finish is magnificent... deep, roasty raisins, plums, some chocolate and a strong molasses presence.  Ultimately a bit thinner than expected, but when you’re comparing something that uses candi sugar to up the gravity without weighting down the palate to American style barley wines, that should be expected.  The port resemblance is there... seems like a definite winter warmer drink, though it was released in May.  I can see how some people might not like this one, there’s a lot of activity... it takes some getting used to.  The bourbon compliments the maple and brown sugar flavors well, and the soy sauce likeness is just below a level at which it would being to annoy.  For what seems like a kitchen-sink brew, it’s quite tasty, and certainly unique. UPDATE:  A day later I realized that it had a flavor that was similar to NyQuil, that hars",0.0,0.9965

With 71B you can get both the fruit and the honey quite well.",0.0,0.8996
Schramm's Madeline🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"Bottle (375 ml), split 2-ways with the lady. 2nd birthday release. Deep purple-red leaving sticky legs on the glass. Aroma is intensely fruity and while I don’t eat boysenberries often it does share many similarities with rapsberries, blackberries and loganberry as the descriptions states. The honey sweet is also felt in the aroma. Taste is, like is so often the case with Schramm’s, a nearly perfect mix of fruit acidity, honey sweetness and alcohol. The blackberry-like features are dominant but I also get some red raspberries notes and bluberries as well as vanilla notes. Medium body. Still. A bit tannic. Fruity finish with lingering honey sweetness and moderate alcohol wamrth. Decadent, yet so well balanced. The first 2-3 sips were blackberry juice alike but once it breathes a bit it reaches world-class level (or Schramm’s level). Another great fruited mead!",0.0,0.974

Schramm's Madeline🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"Batch 2 bottle shared by ygtbsm94 on 10/8/16, thanks Brad!
Deep, burgundy-tinged cherry liquid is bright, clear and shows good viscosity.
The nose is full of lusciously decadent fruit sugars, with strong, balancing acidity. Notes of blueberry, cherry, cranberry and vanilla all provide complexity, as it doesn’t just smell of straight boysenberry. As with their other meads, the alcohol is well-concealed and the mead is clean. Definitely rich, but the acidity easily balances it and leaves it enjoyable.
In the mouth, it’s equally well-balanced, of course sweet and decadent, but with a big, bright acidity boasting of fruit seed, tart juices and rich, concentrated sugars providing a honey-vanilla-like character. Tannin and acidity linger together on an ultra-soft, comforting palate. Little/no alcohol noted, certainly not what would be expected for its size.

This is a gem. The pour is a deep purple-red with no carbonation or head. Just very syrupy. The aroma is unbelievable. So much boysenberry. There is a sweetness about it and a little sharpness from the fruit. A light honey does round out the back end. The flavor is incredible as well. There is a big and dominating berry up front that fades a little toward the back end. The honey is sweet and a light syrup that poke in before a light booze offers itself. It’s a little drier than I’d like. The mouth feel is heavy and syrupy without any carbonation to interrupt it. There is a big berry and light honey combo on the aftertaste. It’s really delicious.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,".355 in Kroken while trying to enjoy Manchester United's Europa League visit to the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán stadium. While I am arguably late to the party Founders' products have increasingly become my go-to brewery over the last couple of years due to the nigh on unbeatable combination of relatively low cost and - crucially - consistently very high quality of their products. I am yet to be disappointed and would argue that Founders is among the beer-aficionado's best friends in these trying times for our world.

Having said that, the deep dark brown slightly oily, murky body of this brew is perhaps not the most inviting. The espresso-coloured head does help improve the looks along with the crocheted lacing. 

Given the alcohol level the first impressions of the aroma are perhaps lighter, less pungent and invasive than one would hope for and expect. Not that it is anything wrong with that, not at all. Regardless, the main impressions are of smoky, slightly bittersweet roasted malts with notes of wet charcoal, freshly baked brown bread and spices. The sweet component might be something akin to vanilla or similar.

The flavour is at first distinctly sweeter when compared to the aroma. Again, this is not a problem, the KBS gives you an initial bitter smack on the snout before soothing you with its sweet touch. This reviewer always enjoy beers where the combination of aroma and flavour are distinctly different but come together to produce a great experience. The dark malts are still there, but the bitterness is less prominent in the notes of cocoa, dark chocolate and coffee. The characteristics of bread and vanilla from the aroma are joined by bourbon barrels leading into a long, dry and bitter finish. One could argue that the finish is too bitter and dry for some, and I might agree at least on some level. Regardless, this combination of aroma and flavours will take you on a rollercoaster-like brewbased thrillride.

All in all the experience is helped by one of the most pleasing palates this reviewer has come across recently. Very much full-bodied, quite creamy, and slightly oily. I swear, this is (even) better than it sounds.

Given my previous Founders reviews this is perhaps getting boring, but this comes - again - very much recommended. Great stuff!",0.042409446483998546,0.9768

Mouthfeel isn’t as think as the pour would suggest, but certainly had a texture.   The first few sips blew me away.  What shot right though the middle was a vegetal, almost green bell pepper streak that I wasn’t expecting at all.  It was enveloped by what you might expect.  Subtly sweetened croissant, toasted grains and yes a touch of a bourbonish aftertaste (not the aftertaste of the beer, the aftertaste of a sip of bourbon).   Again, the vegetal taste really stands out to me in a spectacular way.  This is more savory than sweet and I wasn’t expecting it.  The aftertaste of the beer is not bitter, more toasted, and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome.  There’s absolutely some warmth in the back of the throat.  The complexity is astonishing.

Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"Bottle at home on Christmas Eve. To be honest, I was a bit afraid of it, because it has happened several times that I ran into a beer rated very highly here, which then caused more or less disappointment. After all, in order for something to rise to the status of a legend here on ratebeer, it doesn't hurt if it has many/more reviews, which is relatively rare for new (newer) beers, knowing the site's traffic. At the same time, KBS and only KBS, I thought to myself, surely knows something that will offer something exciting even to a moderately experienced consumer like me. Well, I had to be wrong again. Even putting aside my relatively high expectations, this is certainly decently put together, with a correct little impy with a medium or slightly less intense barrel character. And that's pretty much it. Of course, it's easy to see why it was such a big deal 10-15 years ago, but fortunately nowadays even a moderately good brew can surpass this level by quite a bit.

The coffee, smokiness and bourbon  lasts with some bitterness. The beer is not to sweet like some stouts tend to be and i enjoy that. I like the smokiness but it outbalances  the other subtleties maybe a bit much. all by all a special beer for sure... .",0.0,0.1253

Black as tar with a brownish froth. I am struck immediately by the balance and complexity of the nose. Like studying a dark Rembrandt painting, I drift between the layers, the brushstrokes, the characters within the scene. No particular aroma overpowers the tableau. It goes without saying that dark chocolate and coffee are a strong presence, but too often those smells are broad and generic — KBS goes another step further. The coffee itself is fruity and nuanced, with hints of cherry and brown butter and toffee. There is a hint of vanilla bean, light licorice, some orange peel and mango. Rye bread and blackberry jam. The flavors are equally well balanced. The mouthfeel starts with an inviting, roasted bitterness of dark chocolate, progressing into a sweeter, custardy, vanill-y, crème brûlée, and finishing again with a punch of espresso. Fine carbonation throughout. Again, KBS shows restraint — while bourbon notes are present, they don't overpower. Too many imperial stouts want to boast their barrel-aged bonafides, but end up being as barbaric as a boilermaker. A rousing success.",0.0,0.8898

Pours oily, somewhat milky, ink black with dark chocolate head, surprisingly big for a barrel aged beer.

On the nose an explosion of roasted aromas from coffee to chocolate to burnt caramel to licorice, dried fruit (plums and walnuts) and a finish of woody vanilla and coconut notes certainly given by the aging in bourbon barrels. The beer on the palate is instead a riot of flavors, the entrance is sweet very chocolatey, with hints of coconut vanilla and coffee, then the flavor veers towards a sweet liqueur like Nocino (walnut liqueur) that warms and gives a warming effect, to close on the finish with a light bitter root like licorice that cleans and closes the sip. The carbonation is light and helps the drink. KBS is a cornerstone beer of the American giant Founders Brewing, despite its 12.3 vol % alcohol it is easy to drink. It's a tasty and never cloying beer that gradually warms up allowing each sip to have a different experience from the previous sip.

Very dark with medium-sized, dark brown foam. Excellent chocolate aroma, strong aroma that connotes alcohol presence, doing justice to the 12.4%.

Initially, the flavor is slightly sweet, with toasted malt and a strong flavor of chocolate and vanilla. Coffee also appears and a light fruity flavor that reminds me of coconut.

Very complex beer with
Toasted and long-lasting aftertaste.

Overall Impression-7/10
Total-38/50

Aroma: Very obvious dark chocolate flavor, definitely roasted and burnt, slightly vanilla, coffee sweetness, very slight alcohol. The aroma feels normal, and the spirits are not prominent.

Appearance: Dark brown-black opaque body, chroma of about 40+, slightly brown edges; head of wine is brown, medium thickness, fine foam, very similar to espresso, good durability, and good hanging cup.

Flavor: It tastes quite sweet at the entrance, just like milk chocolate and Black Forest cake. The caramel toffee flavor of dark malt and the nice creamy sweetness brought by bourbon barrels dominate, accompanied by some roasted flavors and burnt flavors of chocolate and coffee, but the roasted aroma is not obvious. There is a slight licorice flavor and medium bitterness in the middle section, a slight mellowness and roasted flavor at the end, and a light burnt acidity and hop wood bitterness in the aftertaste.

Taste: Medium to strong body, very sweet at the entrance, medium killing, and a certain alcohol stimulation.

Overall impression: A famous Bourbon barrel-flavored Imperial Stout, with chocolate and coffee added during brewing. The overall balance is relatively sweet, but not greasy, sweet and mellow, and still has a certain light texture. The bitterness is moderate, which plays a role in balancing the sweetness, and the alcohol taste is not too prominent, which sets off a certain spirit texture. The disadvantage is that although the flavor is enhanced, the aroma is relatively bland, which is within the normal range and there is nothing obvious. The result is that it is easy to drink, but it does not have the rich bitterness of dark chocolate. Is it possible that after two years of aging, the body of the wine has become mellow but the aroma has dissipated?",0.03234231136765754,0.9696
Founders KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout)🇺🇸Stout - Imperial Flavored / Pastry,"2020
Appearance: Black, opaque. Light brown, medium-high foam, mainly fine-bubble, falls after a while to a small ring, leaving a light lacing.

Aroma: Balanced, composed. At a medium-high level, dessert chocolate, cocoa, coffee, a box of chocolates with alcohol, nut wafers with noble alcohol and barrel-aged coconut. In the background, low molasses, dark sponge cake and cake, and a touch of vanilla and oak. In the background, subtle red currant and cranberry.

Taste: Pleasant coffee, Kopiko candies, and noble, although quite sharp alcohol at a medium-high level stand out, countered by the medium barrel-aged sweetness of coconut and a touch of vanilla. Then dessert and dark chocolate, cocoa, molasses, a box of chocolates, and nut wafers. In the background, a touch of red currant and cranberry. Semi-sweet in the mouth, medium body, medium-low carbonation. Medium-low bitterness, mainly alcohol with light bitter chocolate, short. Dry finish with distinct alcohol, alcohol bonbon and dessert chocolate.

Superstition Blue Berry White🇺🇸Mead - Melomel / Fruited,"2 oz sample from kbudd19, massive thanks for this one Kevin!



Appearance: Deep blueberry color with reddish hues and alcohol legs. 



Aroma: Massive blueberry and white chocolate presence. Lots of honey sweetness as well with a bit of alcohol and plums. 



Taste: Really sweet but not unbalanced at all with a massive amount of both blueberries and white chocolate. Rich honey. The alcohol shows up a bit, but isn’t out of place at all. 



Palate: Full body. Mouth coating sweetness. Syrupy mouthfeel. Warming finish. Lingering blueberry and white chocolate presence.



Overall: This is what should be pictured beside the definition of ""decadent"" in the dictionnary. A blueberry-white chocolate cheesecake in a bottle. It’s hard to believe this isn’t completely unbalanced... but it isn’t. Not on the level of Schramm’s The Statement Reserve or Heart of Darkness, but probably the closest contender that I have tried so far. Fantastic stuff!",0.058123819371909635,0.9698
